<pre>The cloud rolls around you like a curtain.**

Then-

He lets out a snort.

> "If I arrested every citizen who stepped in when the Marines didn't, I'd need my own prison fleet."

---

He walks down one step, arms folding across his chest, the coat shifting in the breeze like it's caught its own storm.

> "You acted without orders. Engaged a Warlord. Used an unregistered Devil Fruit in a sovereign conflict."

He looks you dead in the eyes.

> "And you saved lives doing it."

---

Another puff.

> "As far as I'm concerned?"

> "You did my job."

---

He holds out a hand.

Broad. Calloused.

> "Thank you, Mister Cheng."

---

**OOC: You may now respond.**

>> USER: ​Shake it. I have to say, this entire ordeal was all a bad coincidence...

OOC: Tashigi and Vivi observe

**Scene: "The Shake That Meant Something"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Grounded | Mood: Mutual Respect, Quiet Observation**

---

You clasp Smoker's hand.

Firm.

Solid.

The grip of two men who have nothing to prove, but still choose to acknowledge each other.

Your voice stays even, no bluster, no bragging.

> "I have to say..."

> "This entire ordeal was one *hell* of a bad coincidence."

---

Smoker's mouth curls just slightly at one corner.

> "That's the Grand Line for you."

> "People go looking for fortune..."

He releases your hand.

> "And end up in revolutions."

---

Behind you, **Vivi** stands quietly near the column, her expression soft, proud, but wary.

She's watching you like someone seeing a bridge form between two worlds-Marine and Civilian, Power and Principle.

---

**Tashigi**, a few paces off to the side, stands at attention.

But her arms are relaxed now.

And there's just the faintest smirk tugging at her mouth as she watches the handshake.

---

She says nothing.

But her look says enough.

> *"I told you they'd recognize it."*

---

Smoker steps back slightly, gaze flicking toward them both.

> "You've got good people standing beside you."

> "Don't waste that."

Then, back to you:

> "You walking back into your old life after this?"

> "Or are you thinking of something... bigger?"

---

**OOC: You have the floor. You may speak your truth-or play coy.**

>> USER: Explaining the coincidence - originally, when I saw Vivi sneaking around back at Rain Dinners, I was going to report it to you, since I've seen your face in the news. Ended up running into Tashigi-chan instead. Funny how that works out, huh?


Future plans: ​Eh, depends on if I get fired or not for my unexplained absence. Well, if I do I might take on some small bounties to pay the bills. Maybe with at a convenience store.

**Tone: Wry | Mood: Candid, Lightly Reflective, Well-Worn Humor**

---

You give a small, dry chuckle as you shift your weight again, working the stiffness from your legs.

> "Originally, when I saw Vivi sneaking around Rain Dinners..."

You gesture vaguely, like pointing back across time.

> "I was going to report it to you."

> "I recognized your face from the news."

You glance sideways at Tashigi-who now looks just the slightest bit smug.

> "Ended up running into Tashigi-chan instead."

A little smirk, rueful and real.

> "Funny how that worked out, huh?"

---

**Smoker doesn't laugh.**  
But he does let out a long, slow breath that might be the Marine equivalent.

> "The Line's full of twists like that."

> "And she made the right call, if she brought you in."

He jerks his head toward Tashigi.

> "Even if she has terrible taste in backup."

---

**Tashigi, still watching from the side, just scoffs lightly.**

> "He's still standing, isn't he?"

---

You grin-wince a little-then shrug, rolling your shoulder.

> "As for future plans..."

> "Well, that kinda depends on whether I get fired or not."

You scratch your neck, suddenly aware of how absurd your entire résumé has become.

> "If I do, I might take on some small bounties to pay the bills."

> "Maybe find part-time work at a convenience store between hunts."

---

Smoker stares at you.

Then puffs.

Long.

Deliberate.

> "Let me know if you're ever interested in paperwork instead of punchlines."

---

Then he turns-no big speech, no drama-and begins heading back into the palace.

But before he disappears entirely, he says over his shoulder:

> "This wasn't the last war, Teach."

> "Next time, I hope you *choose* to be there."

---

A beat.

He disappears inside.

---

**Vivi walks up beside you now.**

> "He likes you."

---

**Tashigi follows, arms folded, but her tone smug.**

> "That was his version of giving you flowers."

---

You exhale slowly.

---

And for the first time in what feels like a long, long while-

You're not lost.

You're just... **here**.

In one piece.

Surrounded by people who saw what you did and **chose to stay**.

---

**OOC:**
You've officially earned respect from Smoker.  
Tashigi has been vindicated.  
Vivi trusts you deeply.

Would you like to:

1. {Scene skip - Evening. Time to choose your path.}  
2. {A moment alone with Vivi or Tashigi (choose).}  
3. {Head to the palace to rest and reflect.}

>> USER: Option 2 - Vivi and Tashigi mull over the mundane 'future plans' I told Smoker 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Gardens - Just After the Smoke Clears]**  
**Scene: "Part-Time Hero, Full-Time Mystery"**  
**POV: Vivi & Tashigi**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Fond, Frustrated, and Something in Between**

The sun hangs lower now, casting long amber shadows across the palace gardens. The wind stirs the trees gently, petals fluttering from rare desert blossoms, stirred by breath and memory.

You're still nearby-chatting with a palace aide, rubbing your shoulder like the day's weight is just now catching up.

Meanwhile, at a quiet bend in the courtyard, **Vivi and Tashigi stand apart**, watching you from a distance.

Their expressions?

Complex.

---

**Vivi**, arms crossed loosely, looks like someone processing a particularly bizarre math problem.

> "Convenience store."

> "He said convenience store."

---

**Tashigi**, lips pressed, adjusting her glasses:

> "Between bounties."

A pause.

> "Part-time."

---

Vivi sighs through her nose.

> "He saved a kingdom, awakened a Devil Fruit to protect people he barely knew, defied a Warlord, and now he wants to stock canned peaches."

---

**Tashigi** makes a small sound in her throat-equal parts frustration and fondness.

> "He's impossible."

> "Smart enough to infiltrate Baroque Works territory without detection, compassionate enough to nearly die protecting children, *stubborn enough* to fight while half-dead-"

> "And somehow, he thinks he belongs behind a counter saying, ‘Would you like your receipt in the bag?'"

---

**Vivi**, chuckling under her breath:

> "I don't think it's about where he belongs."

> "I think it's about what makes him feel like he's doing something useful."

A pause.

> "Even if that ‘something' is shelf restocking."

---

Tashigi sighs, arms dropping to her sides.

> "It's almost infuriating."

Vivi tilts her head.

> "Almost?"

---

**Tashigi glances toward you.**

You're laughing quietly with a guard now. Light, easy. But there's still something tight in your shoulders, like the weight you carry doesn't quite come off-even when the battle's over.

> "I get it," she murmurs.

> "He doesn't want to be a hero."

> "He just wants to be... useful."

---

They both look at you.

You, who claimed you're **just a teacher**.

You, who **threw yourself between a Warlord and a girl with a country on her shoulders.**

You, who **kept smiling through broken ribs and payroll panic.**

---

> "He's not running," Vivi says quietly.

> "He's just trying to stay grounded."

---

**OOC:**
They both know now.  
You're not just being humble.  
You're trying to survive. Stay sane.  
Stay *you.*
