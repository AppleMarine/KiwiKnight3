<body>
<pre>*burned black**, uniform torn to shreds, arm shaking from the effort.  
Face twisted-not in fear, not even in pain-  
But in **desperate, infuriated will.**

> *Still moving.*  
> *Still trying to protect her.*  
> *Still refusing to die if she's not safe.*

---

**Tashigi's breath catches.**

Her legs falter for half a heartbeat.

> *He's not a marine.*  
> *Not a soldier.*  
> *He was just... a schoolteacher.*  
> *And he's giving more than half the officers she's ever met.*

She's too far. She knows it.

> *I can't reach her.*  
> *I can't stop this.*

She grips her sword tighter-

And her eyes sting.

> "*No...*"

---

**The Straw Hats** begin to turn.  
Sanji sees the cannonball.  
Zoro feels the pressure.  
Luffy-mid-lunge-**freezes**, sensing something **terribly wrong**.

---

But none of them can get there fast enough.

---

Tashigi, helpless, watches you still trying to move, and realizes something she's never dared admit:

> *Justice isn't just about strength.*  
> *It's about showing up.*  
> *Even if you've got nothing left to give.*

And now, **so do they.**

---

**You still have one moment.**  
To speak.  
To act.  
To **choose.**

---

What do you do?

>> USER: â€‹I watch Vivi a moment longer, in horror. Desperation. 
.
.
.
Hate.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - The Breaking of a Quiet Man]**  
**Scene: The Moment the Teacher Cracks | Tone: Raw | Mood: Powerless Rage**

---

You lie in the sand.

Broken.

Burning.

Bleeding.

And **watch.**

---

You watch **Vivi**, standing alone, her weapon slipping from her good hand, her eyes wide but refusing to close.

You watch her about to be **cut** by one monster and **blown apart** by another.

You watch the cannonball **glow** as it's fired.

---

And something in you-

> *Snaps.*

---

Not out of duty.  
Not out of honor.  
Not for bounties or justice or heroic narrative arcs.

No.

You feel something **older**, deeper, **uglier**.

---

> *You hate them.*

You hate that they forced her into this.  
You hate that she thinks this is her burden alone.  
You hate that you're not strong enough to stop it.  
You hate that they made **you** the shield, again and again-  
Until your bones gave way.

---

And in that moment, something inside you-

> *moves.*

Not your legs.

Not your arms.

But your **Devil Fruit**.

---

The juice beneath you-already leaking into the sand-**stirs.**

It **shudders.**

Not like liquid.

But like **wrath.**

Like it heard your fury and said:

> *Okay.*  
> *Let's show them something new.*

---

**OOC: Your emotion-raw hate, not fear-has triggered a mutation.  
Your Paramecia-type Fruit is **responding** to more than your will now.  
It's responding to your **pain** and your **rage.**

Something is about to awaken.  
And the battlefield is about to change.**

---

Would you like to **embrace** this emotion...  
...or **resist** it?

ðŸŒ€ {Choose.}

>> USER: â€‹If only... I had another set of arms to protect her. If I had a substitute teacher... Or perhaps, a substitute kiwi-cher (a portmanteau of kiwi and teacher)

Something pulls in my gut. Something primal. I will my fruit to respond to my desires to protect. 


... And it responds. 

A massive torrent of emerald bursts from the sand in front of Vivi, rising into a massive, legless armed figure. 

A Kiwi elemental. 

OOC: I've awakened a new part of my fruit due to the life and death scenario I'm in. The kiwi elemental is much like the archmage's water elemental ability in Warcraft 3. A large (around two people tall), semi autonomous warrior that fights with concentrated blasts of its constituent liquid. Similar to Charlotte crackers biscuit soldiers, too 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - Awakening: The Substitute Kiwicher]**  
**Scene: The Fruit Answers the Cry | Tone: Cathartic Fury | Mood: Protection Made Manifest**

---

> *If only I had another set of arms...  
Another protector...  
A substitute...*

The pain becomes white.

Your heartbeat slows-

And something in your **gut tightens.**

---

Not from fear.

But from **focus.**

From **the simple, absolute will**:

> *No one touches her.*

---

Your fingers dig into the sand-

And the juice that's been bleeding into the earth for minutes now...  
**Answers.**

It doesn't hiss.  
It **erupts.**

---

A geyser of **vivid emerald juice** blasts up from the dune in front of Vivi, just as the cannonball tears through the air.

**Mr. 4** grins.

**Miss Merry Christmas** lunges.

**Vivi gasps-**not in fear, but in *awe.*

---

The sand explodes upward.

And from it rises **a figure**:

- Eight feet tall.  
- Humanoid in shape but **faceless**, glowing faintly from within.  
- Its arms are thick, rippling **currents of juice**, swirling around skeletal citrus fibers.  
- No legs. Just a **flowing base** of churning pulp that hovers over the ground like a semi-liquid spirit.

**The Substitute Kiwicher.**

---

It moves the moment it forms-no hesitation.

Its first arm **slams forward**, a wall of concentrated kiwi pulp **colliding with the cannonball mid-air**.

> *BOOM-SSSSSSSHHHH-!!*

The explosion is **muted**, cushioned by the blast-absorbing juice.  
Shrapnel still rains-but it misses **Vivi entirely**.

---

The other arm turns.

**Miss Merry Christmas**, caught mid-leap, eyes wide, lets out a **scream**-

> "WHAT THE HELL IS THAT-?!"

Before a **cannon-like blast of compressed golden juice** smashes into her side and sends her flying end over end into the nearest dune.

---

**The elemental lets out no sound.  
No words.  
Just swirls, pulses, and floats.**

It positions itself squarely in front of Vivi, one massive arm out, shielding her.  
The other whirls, forming a **new blast in its palm**.

---

Vivi's hands tremble.

She looks at you-

Still on the ground, broken.

And sees you **grinning.**

Blood on your lips.  
Pride in your eyes.

---

**OOC - NEW ABILITY UNLOCKED: Devil Fruit Sub-Awakening: Substitute Kiwicher**

- **Form:** Large, semi-autonomous humanoid made of concentrated kiwi juice.

   - Shield-forming limb morphs.

---

**The battlefield has changed.  
The tide has turned.  
And the crew is almost here.**

---

**What do you do?**

1. {Speak. Through cracked lips. "Nobody hurts my students."}  
2. {Try to direct the elemental-"Cover her. Hit him." See if it understands.}  
3. {Laugh. Low. "I told you, Blue... I'm the teacher."}  
4. {Say nothing. Let them witness what your will has created.}  
5. {Tell Vivi to finish this. "You've got backup now. Go."}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 1 - Growl. No one hurts the kids while I still draw breath. No one..

Vivi now has backup in her fight. It continues.

Tashigi notices an emerald Titan erupt from the sands next to Vivi, a wild look on my bloodied face

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - Guardian Awakened]**  
**Scene: The Teacher's Wrath | Tone: Heroic Ferocity | Mood: Turning Point**

---

The wind dies.  
The battlefield stills.

Only the crackle of dispersing cannonfire and the dull thrum of your pounding heart remains.

---

You push your face from the sand-barely an inch.  
Spit a mix of blood and grit to the side.  
And through teeth gritted so tight your jaw pops, you growl low and mean:

> "No one... hurts the kids... while I still draw breath..."

Your voice shakes.  
Your body is broken.  
But your **will**-

> Has become a **titan.**

---

The **Substitute Kiwicher** looms above Vivi now-its massive torso pulsing with glowing citrus light, one arm extended as a barrier, the other charging a new blast of dense emerald liquid.

Vivi doesn't step back.

She steps **forward**, regaining her stance.

Now it's **her** turn to strike.

She whirls one slasher whip around the elemental</pre>
