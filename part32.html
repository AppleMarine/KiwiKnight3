**📝 Combat Status:**

- **Zoro is inside the cage retrieving Luffy.**  
- **You are between the crew and the Gators.**  
- **Juice tripwires active.**  
- **Gators are closing fast.**  
- **Evac path (juice waterfall): open and active.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Launch a juice blast directly at the leading Gator's eyes-blind it, stagger the others.}  
2. {Let the first Gator hit the tripwire, then strike when it's tangled. Clean takedown.}  
3. {Order Tashigi: "Get them up the waterfall. I'll hold the line."}  
4. {Begin freezing the platform beneath the Gators with sticky pulp. Make it harder to leap.}  
5. {Wait. Brace. Let them come-and counter hard.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 1 - Maybe I can scare them off. Prepare multiple droplets of Kiwi Juice in the air, and launch them like micro flechettes of very expired pepper spray at the surfaced gators.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected - "Fruit-Flavored War Crime: Citrus Flechette Edition."**  
**Tone: Controlled Ferocity | Action: Kiwi Blitz**  
**🎲 Juice Attack Roll - (Eatone +2 Fruit Weaponization, +1 Pressure Modulation, +1 Blinding Acidity) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎲 Gator Resistance Roll - (Banana Gator +2 Tough Hide, -2 Sensitive Eyes/Nostrils, -1 Surprise) = Result: 1 [Poor]**  
**✅ Outcome: Your micro-flechettes strike with brutal precision. You don't just hurt them-you **scatter** them. One flails. One *screams*. The others **panic**. You are, now and forever, the **Juice of God.**

---

You exhale slowly, lift your off-hand, and let the pressure rise.

> *Kiwi juice orbs-six of them-float mid-air*  
> Each no larger than a marble. Each pulsing faintly with volatile citrus rage.

You calculate trajectory-**eyes, nostrils, open maws.**  
Then-*flick*.

> "Time to sting."

You fire.

The droplets **sharpen mid-flight**, congealing into tiny acidic flechettes-**pulp-loaded with sour enzymes and astringent burn**, each one carrying the **chemical vengeance of a poorly refrigerated fruit smoothie left in the sun.**

---

**Impact:**

- First Gator: Direct hit to the left eye. It **screeches**, thrashing in the water, tail slamming the pit wall.
- Second: Hit across its upper gums and inner nostrils. **Chokes violently.** Submerges in a panic swirl.
- Third: Sees the splash, smells the air-and **bails**. Full tail-turn retreat into the deeper current.

For a moment, the entire pit **erupts in chaos**, water splashing, chains shaking, foam flying. The cage itself sways with the backlash.

---

Tashigi stares.

> "You *pepper-sprayed an apex predator.*"

> "Not my first faculty meeting."

---

**Inside the cage:**

Zoro now has Luffy **over his shoulder**, and is climbing out with the easy athleticism of a man who *bench-presses ghosts for fun*.  
Luffy murmurs something. Still half-conscious.

> "Smells... like breakfast..."

---

**📝 Combat Update:**

- Three Banana Gators: **Neutralized. Blinded. Disoriented.**  
- Luffy: Being carried out of the cage by Zoro  
- You: **Still standing in defense.**  
- The crew: Safe behind you, fully aware this is **go-time**.  
- Juice waterfall: Still flowing. Still the escape route.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Signal the crew. "Now. Up the waterfall. Go." Prioritize evac. You'll go last.}  
2. {Assist Zoro-form a juice platform for his jump. Luffy's heavy. Make it smooth.}  
3. {Prepare a parting shot-line up one last juice cluster to detonate as a full-pit smokescreen.}  
4. {Back up slowly, baton raised-cover the crew as they begin escaping.}  
5. {Ask Tashigi to head up first with Vivi and Chopper. Divide protection and direction.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option X - Look around for Smoker. Is he in another room? Also, where's crocodile?

OOC: Sanji may have sprung his Mr. prince gambit, unaware of what's going on below.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option X Selected - "Status Check: Where's the Chain-Smoker and the Sand Bastard?"**  
**Tone: Strategic Pause in the Eye of a Fruit-Flavored Hurricane**  
**🎲 Situational Awareness Roll - (Eatone +2 Battlefield Focus, +1 Recent Recon Knowledge) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Environmental Scan - (Tashigi +1 Marine Memory, -1 Tunnel Complexity) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**✅ Outcome: Smoker's not in this room-**but you now have a strong sense of where he might be. As for Crocodile? He's off-stage... but the **air has shifted.** Something's *coming.*

---

You stand, breathing deep, acid still tingling your palm, eyes scanning the platform.

You glance to Tashigi, who's standing guard at the rear. You speak low:

> "Where's your captain?"

She blinks, then curses under her breath.

> "Not here. This was the Straw Hats' cage only."

She looks toward a dark tunnel near the opposite end of the pit-previously sealed with a grated iron gate, now slightly ajar.

> "Smoker must be in the **secondary cell block.** That access tunnel links to Crocodile's *personal holding chamber.*  
He keeps ‘high-value threats' away from his spectacles."

You frown.

> "And where's Crocodile?"

That's when it hits you. Not sound. Not vibration.

> **Pressure.**

The **air changes** again, dry and hot.  
The scent of sand, faint but rising.  
Your hair shifts. The **juice on your skin tightens**, reacting instinctively to what's coming.

Tashigi's eyes narrow.

> "He's back."

---

**OOC Update:**  
Sanji, per canon, has just triggered his **Mr. Prince gambit**. He's in the casino above, manipulating enemy agents and calling Crocodile away.

**Canon Divergence Trigger: LOW.** Sanji's distraction might not work now that **you've altered the timing**.

---

**📝 Tactical Intel Update:**

- **Smoker is *not* here**. Likely held in a **secondary chamber** across the pit. Accessible-but **not safely**.  
- **Crocodile is returning.** You can feel it. You may have **seconds** before he reappears.  
- **Evac path is open**, but time is **very limited**.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Evac everyone. Immediately. No detours. You'll deal with Smoker *later*.}  
2. {Send Tashigi with the Straw Hats. *You* go for Smoker. Solo op.}  
3. {Signal Zoro-ask him to take Luffy up, then join you for a two-man rescue run.}  
4. {Delay. Prep juice tripwires and traps for Crocodile at the chamber entrance. One shot ambush.}  
5. {Call out loud: "Warlord's coming. Move!" Drop the teacher voice. Rise into full command.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit. I look at Tashigi with wide eyes. He's coming. Your CO's going to have to wait.

Frantically motion to the rest to huddle up around me, and start conjuring a large puddle of kiwi juice at my feet.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Action Selected - "Oh Shit Protocol: Emergency Fruit Evac in Progress."**  
**Tone: Controlled Panic | Action: Defensive Extraction via Citrus Slipstream**  
**🎲 Crisis Control Roll - (Eatone +2 Leadership Under Fire, +1 Devil Fruit Synchronicity, +1 Survival Instincts) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎲 Crew Compliance - (Tashigi +2 Discipline, Zoro/Nami/Vivi +2 Trust in You, +1 Shared Fear of Crocodile) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**✅ Outcome: Your instincts fire at maximum capacity. The crew rallies around you. Juice floods the platform. **Evacuation is *imminent***-and this is going to be *messy, heroic,* and *damn citrusy.***

---

> "Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh *SHIT-*"

You don't scream it-you *breathe it*, like a prayer, like a man about to cast a final exam into a bonfire.

Your head snaps to Tashigi.

> "He's coming.  
**Your CO's gonna have to wait.**"

Tashigi doesn't hesitate.

She doesn't question.  
She **nods**.

You spin to the Straw Hats-Zoro now carrying Luffy, Nami clutching Chopper, Vivi wide-eyed but clear-headed.

> "Huddle up! Now! CLOSE!"

You slam your palm into the floor and pour every ounce of will, fear, instinct, and **righteous juice** into the surface.

> **FWOOOOM-**

A **puddl</pre>
