<pre>SER: Option 2

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - The Throne Room, Reclaimed]**  
**Scene: "A Kingdom, A Father, A Daughter"**  
**POV: Vivi Nefertari**  
**Tone: Emotional Resolution | Mood: Soft, Triumphant, Bittersweet**

---

The war is over.

The kingdom is soaked.

The stone steps are **slippery with juice**, the flags half-torn, the palace cracked-

But it's **home**.

And for the first time in weeks-**no one is shouting**.

---

The doors to the throne room creak open.

**Vivi**, still in her battle-stained clothes, a damp bandage around her shoulder, walks carefully across the sticky tiles.  
Behind her: Marines, Straw Hats, Tashigi...

And a **limp, snoring teacher** being carted in a makeshift juice-stained litter.

But Vivi doesn't look at them.

She looks ahead.

At the throne.

At the man beside it.

---

**King Cobra** stands-propped up, wounded, held by guards-  
but he's smiling.

---

> "Vivi..."

His voice cracks.

---

She runs.

Straight into his arms.

And for a moment, the whole palace-**the whole city**-holds its breath.

---

> "You came back to me," he whispers.

> "You came back *home.*"

---

Vivi's hands clench in his royal robes.

> "I almost didn't make it."

> "But I wasn't alone."

She pulls back just slightly, turning her head-

And gestures toward the ragtag group behind her.

A **rubber man**, a **green-haired swordsman**, a **navigator covered in glue**, a **reindeer**, a **sharpshooter with goggles**, a **blond chef**, a **Marine woman**, and-

> "...him."

She smiles faintly.

> "The most reluctant hero I've ever met."

---

Cobra raises an eyebrow.

> "The unconscious one?"

> "...Snoring on my carpet?"

---

> "He's a teacher," Vivi says proudly.

> "A good one."

---

Cobra nods, faintly amused.

> "Then I suppose we owe the state of our floors-and our future-to education."

---

They laugh together.

Broken laughter. Happy laughter. The laughter of survivors.

And the kingdom begins to breathe again.

---

**OOC:**
- Vivi and Cobra have reunited.
- The palace is secure.
- Your contributions have been acknowledged, if not fully understood.
- The final pieces are falling into place.

Would you like to:

1. {Scene shift to Eatone finally waking up, safe.}  
2. {Straw Hats prepare to depart.}  
3. {Scene skip: Return to your homeland. The war is over.}

>> USER: Option X - Cobra teases about where a certain teacher's head was landing

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - The Royal Carpet's Revenge]**  
**Scene: "Fatherly Teasing"**  
**POV: Cobra Nefertari**  
**Tone: Warm | Mood: Gentle Humor with Parental Sass**

---

The laughter between **father and daughter** begins to fade into a soft, warm quiet.  

For the first time since the rebellion began, **King Cobra** looks around his fractured throne room with something approaching peace.

Until...

> *snrk*  
The unconscious, juice-scented lump on the palace floor **snorts in his sleep**, flops, and mutters something about **"grading on a curve."**

---

Cobra arches an eyebrow.

> "...Vivi."

> "This brave soul who helped save the kingdom..."

He gestures toward you with the subtle theatricality of a seasoned ruler who's **definitely preparing a zinger**.

> "He spent much of that time, if reports are to be believed, passed out..."

He glances sideways at his daughter, who now looks **dangerously flushed**.

> "...*in your lap*?"

---

Vivi sputters.

> "Th-That was-! I mean-he was *injured*! He kept *falling*! I was just the *nearest* surface!"

---

> "Mmhmm," Cobra says, nodding solemnly.

> "Yes, I often find myself falling into the laps of noblewomen after strenuous diplomatic efforts."

---

**Tashigi**, nearby, coughs into her fist in an attempt to not **laugh herself into a hernia**.

> "It was tactical, Your Majesty."

> "Unintentional tactical... collapse."

---

Vivi crosses her arms.

> "Well maybe I *should've* let him fall on the cobblestones!"

---

From the floor, you let out a very small, very pleased sigh:

> "Mmm... noblewoman pillows..."

---

The entire room freezes.

---

**Cobra looks down at you.**

Smirks.

> "Very well. Make sure that one gets a medal."

> "And a *firm lecture.*"

---

**OOC:**
- Cobra is officially a **dad** again.
- You are officially the **court's favorite gossip**.
- Vivi is **never going to live this down**.
- You, in your semi-conscious state, may have just flirted with royalty again.

Would you like to:

1. {Wake up now. You've earned it.}
2. {Time skip - later that night. A quiet conversation.}
3. {Skip to the Straw Hats' departure. Final farewell.}

>> USER: Option 2 - The Marines haven't arrived in force yet (aside from Smoker's small unit, who were already here), due to the comms blackout, they are only now mobilizing units to come secure the country, and like won't arrive for another few days.

Unlike canon, Luffy did not pass out from exhaustion, and the crew are happily enjoying feasts, praises, and the palace's facilities (the ones that remain undamaged)

I am out like a light.

What are Smoker and Tashigi up to? 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Evening, Post-Battle]**  
**Scene: "Marine Interlude: Reports, Regrets, and Rooftop Cigars"**  
**POV: Smoker & Tashigi**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Quiet Frustration, Earned Respect**

---

The sun sinks behind the far dunes of Alabasta, casting long orange shadows over **a kingdom that survived**. The sounds of celebration echo from the palace: laughter, clinking plates, **an unholy amount of kiwis being eaten**, and the occasional roar of "Another round for Snack Pack!!" from the feasting halls.

---

But high above it all-on a secluded, sand-dusted rooftop-**Smoker leans against a crumbling stone column**, his coat still stained with soot and pulp, a half-burned cigar clenched between his teeth.

**Tashigi** sits nearby, perched on the ledge, legs dangling over the city.

Between them, a stack of papers.

And on the top?

A hastily written, heavily juice-smeared incident report.

---

> "So..."  
> Smoker growls around his cigar.  
> "Tell me again how exactly a **schoolteacher** ended up *summoning a fruit elemental*, hijacking the warlord's kill shot, and napping in royalty's lap *twice*."

---

Tashigi, unusually quiet, flips a page in the report.

> "He... didn't *mean* to. I think."

---

Smoker exhales smoke through his nose.

> "No one *means* to become a national hero by accident."

---

He glances sideways at her.

> "You vouched for him."

---

She stiffens, then nods slowly.

> "He risked his life to protect Vivi. More than once. He could've run... He almost did. But he stayed."

A pause.

> "He's not a fighter. He's not built for this. But he stood his ground anyway."

---

Smoker watches the lights flickering in the palace windows-  
he can almost hear Sanji bragging in the distance, or Zoro yelling about being lost in a hallway again.

He grunts.

> "Straw Hats are still here. And that teacher of yours..."

Another puff.

> "...He's got â€˜wild card' written all over him."

---

Tashigi lets out a dry chuckle.

> "I'm pretty sure he's still asleep in a guest room."

> "They put him in a cot with like six pillows. I think he started crying in his sleep."

---

Smoker snorts.

> "Soft."

He says it like an insult.

But doesn't mean it.

---

They fall into a companionable silence.

The **night wind kicks up**, carrying scents of roasted meat, baked bread, and kiwi tarts.

And below them, Alubarna glows.

Alive.

---

> "We're still a few days from backup," Smoker mutters.  
> "Want me to assign a full squad to watch him?"

---

> "No," Tashigi replies, standing.  
> "I'll watch him myself."

---

She turns toward the stairwell.

> "Besides... he doesn't need guards."

> "He needs someone to remind him that what he did mattered."

---

Smoker watches her go.

Then looks back toward the city again.

And mutters to no one:

> "You better not disappoint her, Pineapple."

---

**OOC:**
- Smoker and Tashigi are holding the line while the rest of the Marine</pre>
