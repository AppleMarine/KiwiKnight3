<pre>f sugar and pulp.

> Miss Merry Christmas won't catch you from underneath again.

Above, your arcing **shield dome** still glistens-cutting off direct hits from Mr. 4's cannon dog. For now.

---

**Across the sands:**

**Mr. 4** lowers his bazooka again, stupid grin fixed in place like a kid proud of a crayon drawing of a car crash.

His dog barks again-*"BOOF!"*  
The second cannonball **fires**, sailing **high**, arcing above the barrier, aiming to **drop in from the top.**

You twist your head up-

> "He's lobbing it now!"

---

At the same time-  
> *RUMBLE*

The sand below **vibrates violently**-a new tunnel opening directly beneath your new floor.

Your **juice disc pulses once**, resisting, bulging-

> Then **Merry Christmas** *explodes* out of the ground-  
> **Claws extended**, eyes wild, teeth flashing-

> "**GOTCHA, PRETEND HERO-!!**"

But she **hits the disc at full speed**-and it **bounces her like a trampoline made of stubborn fruit.**

She *screeches*, flipping midair as she hits the inner curve of your juice dome like a ping-pong ball-

> *THWAP-CRASH-ROLL*

Sand flies everywhere.

---

**Meanwhile...**

Vivi sees the descending cannonball-  
Her eyes widen-

And she **moves**.

Fast.

> "Get ready-I'll redirect it!"

She launches a **peacock-slasher wire** upward-snagging a nearby **broken mast pole** from the skiff, still embedded in the sand.

With a cry, she **pulls**, launching the pole like a spear into the air-**intercepting the cannonball mid-arc!**

> *BOOM!*

It explodes **above** you-raining scorched pulp, sand, and shrapnel.

But you and Vivi are **safe** beneath your dome.

---

**OOC: Combat Status**

- **You:** Injured, but shielded and holding. Disc floor + dome active.  
- **Vivi:** Actively engaged, clever use of environment, no injuries.  
- **Miss Merry Christmas:** Dazed from the rebound, tumbling in the sand.  
- **Mr. 4:** Reloading, slower than sin, but undamaged. The dog barks happily.  
- **Crew:** Still at distance, likely aware but not yet present.

---

**Initiative: Yours.**

**What do you do next?**

1. {Break the dome, rush Miss Merry Christmas while she's down-juiced baton and all.}  
2. {Focus on Mr. 4-fire an acidic burst at him while he reloads. The gun *can't bark if it's blind.*}  
3. {Help Vivi finish off Merry Christmas-two-on-one beatdown.}  
4. {Try to bind Mr. 4's legs with golden juice-immobilize the gunner before he fires again.}  
5. {Layer another trap-sticky mist this time. Obscure your next move, control the field.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your move.}

>> USER: Option 1 - he's still reloading, might as well go after his partner.

OOC: These are elite Baroque agents. Weigh combat rolls more heavily against us.

**Initiative: Eatone | Opponent: Miss Merry Christmas (Elite Agent)**

---

> "He's reloading."

You hiss it through gritted teeth as your baton **snaps out**, extending with a metallic *crack* and **gleaming Seastone tip**.  
Your eyes lock onto **Miss Merry Christmas**, who's just now rising from her tumble-**spitting sand**, growling, claws tearing at the ground like she's about to dig again.

You lunge forward-  
**Juice mist curling at your heels**, dome parting behind you like an opening curtain.

---

**COMBAT ROLL: Eatone vs. Miss Merry Christmas**  
- Eatone: (+2 Baton Technique, +1 Initiative, -1 Injury Penalty)  
- Roll Total: **6 [Great]**  
- Miss Merry Christmas: (+2 Agility, +1 Underground Awareness, +1 Elite Tier Bonus)  
- Roll Total: **7 [Fantastic]**

---

You reach her-  
Strike low, Seastone tip arcing for the ribs-  
But **she's faster**.

> "NICE TRY, JUICE BOX!"

She **spins** out of reach with a screeching cackle, claw slashing upward, catching your baton and **twisting it** wide. The impact sends **shockwaves through your arm**-your already bruised ribs protesting hard.

She follows up-  
One clawed hand **tearing at your coat**, slicing just beneath your ribs-  
Not a deep cut, but **enough to drop you to a knee**.

---

> "Y'think you can take *me*?!" she howls, eyes wide.  
> "I've eaten boys braver than you for breakfast-and they weren't covered in *fruit!*"

---

**Vivi shouts from behind:**  
> "Eatone!"

You're **still conscious**, but off-balance.  
Blood's dripping down your side.

---

**OOC: You engaged a Baroque elite directly, and she's **faster and meaner** than expected. You missed your hit, and took a shallow slash-combat tier is weighed against you, as per instruction.  
You can still fight, but you're now **more heavily wounded** and visibly flagging.**

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Fall back-try to regroup with Vivi. Two-on-one again. You've got better odds that way.}  
2. {Feint left, spray mist into her face point-blank-**go for the eyes.**}  
3. {Collapse your juice floor into a sticky sinkhole beneath her. Trap her, even if it drops you too.}  
4. {Call out: "Blue! Go for her knees!" Coordinate with Vivi from where you are.}  
5. {Stay down. Let her come to you-and hit her with the baton when she gets cocky. Classic bait.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 2 - Engage with juice, spray some greener juice towards her face.

Wait... She's a mole mole fruit user, right? Do moles even care about their eyes?

Your breath catches.  
You can feel blood running down your side.  
Your baton's out of position.  
She's winding up for another slash.

But you've still got **one weapon ready.**

Your **hands.**

You thrust your palm upward and release a **sharp, acidic burst** of **green kiwi juice**, willing it with every fiber of your bruised being to **sting and blind**.

> *PSHHT!*

A narrow **spray arcs** toward Miss Merry Christmas's face.

It hits.

Direct.

Right in the **eyes**.

She **screeches**, stumbling back-

> "AGHHH-YOU FILTHY FRUIT-FLINGING PIECE OF-!!"

---

But wait-

You pause, chest heaving, as she **doesn't** stumble like someone blinded.

She flails, yes, but-

> "*You idiot!*" she screams.  
> "I'm a **MOLE**!"

You blink.

> "*Moles don't even need eyes, dumbass!*"

You blink **again**.

> "...Right."

---

She **charges blindly anyway**, her claws out wide, still deadly, **undeterred by the juice to her face**.

---

**OOC Result:**

- Juice spray: **Direct hit.**  
- **Effectiveness**: *Minimal*. Mole-Mole Fruit enhances tunneling and digging instincts, and Miss Merry Christmas is **highly adapted** to fighting **without visual cues**.  
- You **wasted a turn's worth of effort**, and she's still coming.  
- However, the acidic properties still **irritated** her-enough to unbalance her next attack slightly.

**Next Attack Roll (from her):**  
- -1 penalty on her next roll due to temporary irritation.

---

**Vivi is now moving in.**

You hear her wire slingers **snap**, whistling through the air.

---

**What's your next move?**

1. {Take the opportunity-swing your baton low while she's off-balance.}  
2. {Create a slippery surface under her-try to trip her mid-charge.}  
3. {Duck and call out to Vivi: "NOW!" Let her strike from behind.}  
4. {Drop to the ground and roll. You're buying space.}  
5. {Pray your students never hear about this fight. Keep swinging.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 5 - Attempt to guard or evade her attack. Keep an eye on Mr. 4

---

You tighten your stance-if you can call the way your knees are **screaming** and your ribs feel like a classroom desk fell on you a "stance"-and keep your baton raised, held cross-body in a **defensive guard**.

Miss Merry Christmas is charging like a </pre>
