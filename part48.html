<pre>tiveness-**she's not used to it coming without a leash.**  
- She trusts you.  
- Her mention of Igaram is a sign that she sees you in the same circle as people she once counted on.  
- You've now seen **past the princess**, and she knows it.

---

**Meanwhile: Bon Clay is still stuck.  
Tashigi is almost on him.  
The tide of battle is shifting.**

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Stay silent, but stay beside her. Sometimes presence is the reply.}  
2. {Nod to her. "When this is over, I'll stick around long enough to find him. Deal?"}  
3. {Crack a smile. "Sounds like he and I would've gotten along. Loudly."}  
4. {Turn back to the fight. She's standing. You've got more kids to keep alive.}  
5. {Break into a new juice move-juice shield, mist screen, or variant? Test the Fruit again.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 1 - observe the battle - Luffy throwing, sanji diving in a kit, Nami putting together a thundercloud. 

I remark to Vivi. Is it just me, or are these Baroque folks kind of weak? 

I point to Zoro holding his own against Mr. 1. That's a kid fighting and winning against what looks like one of their top agents

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River Skirmish - Battlefield Watch]**  
**Tone: Reflective Observation | Mood: Calm in the Chaos, Respect Gaining Root**

---

You fall quiet again, letting Vivi's words settle between you like dust on windblown stone.

Then-without fanfare-you shift your weight, eyes scanning the battlefield as the din of the fight surges around you.

---

> **Luffy**, wild grin wide, flings a Baroque agent bodily into the river, the man skipping across the surface like a rock shot from a cannon.  
> **Sanji**, hair wind-blown, is diving through debris, spinning mid-air to *dropkick* someone directly into the *bottom half of a crate marked "fragile."*  
> **Nami**, up on a broken ridge of stone, finishes building a swirling thundercloud the size of a carriage. Sparks crackle as she levels her clima-tact at **Miss Doublefinger**, who is looking more than a little *concerned.*

And there-

> **Zoro.**  
Holding the line.  
Chest cut. Breathing hard.  
But **grinning.**

He shifts, steps into **Mr. 1's steel blade**, and with a roar, **parries it clean.**  
Muscles straining.  
But not breaking.

---

You nod toward that last one.

> "That's a kid fighting and winning against what looks like one of their top agents."

You say it quietly, eyes narrowing.

Then, a slight smirk creeps onto your face.

> "Is it just me, or are these Baroque folks kind of... weak?"

---

**Vivi's head tilts.**

She watches for a beat.

Then gives a quiet laugh.

> "No. They're not weak."

She gestures toward Zoro.

> "He's just strong."

A pause.

Then softer:

> "They all are. That's why I trusted them. Why I asked for their help."

She glances up at you, smile faint but real.

> "And now you're here too."

---

You feel the wind shift.

The river below churns.

And across the battlefield, **Bon Clay wails as Tashigi finally reaches him**, sword out, expression utterly *done* with watching herself flop like a ballerina in heat.

---

**OOC Update:**

- You remain beside Vivi, fully protecting her.  
- You've now witnessed the Straw Hats **holding their own** or outright dominating elite agents.  
- Your respect for them-despite the pirate label-is growing.  
- Vivi has **reaffirmed her trust** in them, and by extension, in **you**.

---

**The tide is turning.  
The river to Alubarna lies ahead.**

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Signal the crew. "Clear the rest-we move in two!" You're ready to push forward.}  
2. {Turn to Vivi. "You chose well, Blue."}  
3. {Go help Tashigi deal the finishing blow to Bon Clay. Might be cathartic.}  
4. {Summon juice mist forward. Start laying cover for the final push.}  
5. {Stay where you are. The war's not over. Not until the princess makes it.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 5 - Maintain position, let the others clean up. I'm no fighter, just a teacher.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - The Teacher Holds the Line]**  
**Tone: Grounded Resolve | Mood: Quiet Strength Amidst Chaos**

---

You keep your stance steady, baton low, juice still clinging to your fingertips, mist curling lazily around your boots like a living thing at rest.

The others?

They're the chaos.

- **Luffy** is swinging wide arcs, fists like cannons, laughter echoing even through dust and heat.  
- **Nami** finally lets loose her built-up cloud-**lightning spears** down, slamming Miss Doublefinger into the sand with a cry of pain.  
- **Zoro** is bleeding, but **Mr. 1** has taken a step back now, visibly rattled.  
- **Tashigi** has Bon Clay by the collar, sword at his throat. He's too stuck to escape, and judging by her expression, he's about to get a very *personal* lecture on *identity theft*.  
- **Sanji** is helping Chopper back up while kicking an unconscious footsoldier off the skiff.  
- **Usopp**, still shouting, appears to have deployed a device labeled **"DON'T TOUCH THIS BUTTON"**, which is now **smoking ominously.**

But you?

You don't move.

> "I'm no fighter," you mutter. "Just a teacher."

You glance to your side.

Vivi is still there.  
Calm. Present. Watching you.

She doesn't question it.  
She doesn't challenge it.

She just stands a little closer.

---

Around you, the battle **resolves**.

Smoke rises.

Bodies groan.

The Baroque elite?  
**Falling back. Defeated. Immobilized.**

And the Straw Hats-**standing.**

---

The river glints ahead.

And far beyond the dunes-  
**Alubarna waits.**

Still in danger.  
Still divided.

But now... there's a way forward.

---

**OOC: You chose restraint. You held position.**

- Your decision to remain with Vivi allowed the others to fight freely, unburdened by split priorities.  
- Your defense of the Princess wasn't flashy-but **it was necessary**.  
- The battlefield is yours, and you walk away **without a scratch**, but with the **full trust** of those you protected.

---

**Next Scene: Aftermath at the Riverbank. Recovery. Regroup. Planning the push into Alubarna.**

Do you wish to remain with Vivi during the fallout, speak to a specific crewmate, or observe quietly as the crew regathers?

**This is your moment of pause. Where do you go?**

>> USER: As Tashigi and the straw hats continue finishing their respective battles, Vivi and I head off the beached ship and down to the riverbank.

I start to relax, when I notice a glint in a distant sandbank. At the same time, I feel a bit of rumbling under my feet. ...huh?

OOC: Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas have joined the battle.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - False Calm | Scene: The Burrowers Arrive]**  
**Tone: Sudden Tension | Mood: Just When You Thought It Was Safe**

---

The skirmish fades into its final act behind you-cheers, groans, the occasional Bon Clay sobbing about "stage lighting betrayal."  
The sun hangs low. The air is dry.

You and Vivi step down from the battered skiff, boots pressing into warm sand that should feel reassuring, steady.

For the first time in what feels like **forever**, you start to **relax**.

Baton holstered. Mist withdrawn. Shoulders loosened.

> "We're clear," you start to say.

Then you see it.

> A glint.  
Just a flash of metal-**sharp, distant**, and deliberate-on a sandbank far to the side, where no one should be.

And then you **feel it**.

A rumble.  
Low. Rolling. Wrong.

---

Your boot **vibrates**, then shifts as the sand beneath you **buckles**, just slightly-like the earth hiccupped.

You immediately throw an arm in front of Vivi, stepping in front of her with a quiet curse.

> "Huh?"

But your instincts scream something else:

> *Trap.*

---

Behind you, the crew is still recovering, laughter mixing with exhaustion.

> They don't see the glint.  
> They don't feel the rumble yet.

---

Then the sand to your left **explodes**.

**FWOOOM-!!**

A **mole-shaped missile** of a woman bursts up from beneath the dunes-wild hair flaring, lipstick smeared in a vil</pre>
