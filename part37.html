Then-  
The camel rounds a corner.  
The **main docks** open before you.

And **there**, pushing toward the farthest pier-

- A blue-haired girl-**Vivi**.  
- A swordsman lugging a rubbery unconscious man-**Zoro and Luffy**.  
- Nami and Chopper, wild-eyed, nearly running.  
- And at their back, Tashigi, sword out, **watching the crowd for threats.**

You're **maybe fifty meters away.**

> "THAT'S THEM! GET ME TO THAT PIER!"

The driver cackles.

> "Hold on, big spender!"

---

**📝 Status Update:**

- You are **seconds away** from rejoining the crew at the docks.  
- No Baroque Works agents in sight-yet.  
- Docks are still **open**-but patrols are moving in.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Dismount in full style. "Room for one more?" Join the escape crew.}  
2. {Throw extra Beri to your driver. "Scatter! Make noise-buy us thirty seconds!"}  
3. {Signal Tashigi and Vivi-"It's me! Move faster!"}  
4. {Juice skate off the camel and into the crew, ready to blast any agents appearing.}  
5. {Quickly grab water and food from a pier stall for the group, just in case. You might need it.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: OOC: Scene shift to Tashigi's group.

When the bounty hunter told her he'd buy them time, she quickly made off with Vivi and her entourage, expecting him to catch up. To her growing horror, he never appears. A clash of guilt, and duty to get Vivi and the Straw Hats to safety clash in her mind.

Tashigi's boots **pound against the sunbaked planks** of the Rainbase docks, each step dragging a heavier weight behind it-not just the growing presence of Marines, tourists, and whispering Baroque agents in disguise...

...but the **suffocating silence** from behind.

> *He said he'd cover us.*  
> *Said he'd buy us time.*

She throws a sharp glance back toward the shimmering heat-haze of the city's outer rim.  
No sign of him.  
Not a smear of citrus. Not a glint of soaked coat. Not even the sarcastic bark she'd come to find strangely reliable.

> "Dammit... Cheng."

---

**Zoro** grunts beside her, Luffy still slung like a sack of meat over his shoulder.

> "We stopping for something?"  
> "You left someone?"

Tashigi doesn't answer at first.  
Just clenches her jaw and picks up speed.

**Nami**, panting as she pulls Chopper along, throws a sharp look.

> "We don't have time for dramatic hesitations, Marine."

> "I know that."

Her voice is low. Controlled.  
Barely.

**Vivi** places a hand on Tashigi's arm. It's trembling-only slightly.

> "He said he'd catch up."  
> "Maybe he already escaped by another route..."

Tashigi exhales through her teeth, eyes stinging-not from the sun.

> "No. He would've said something. He's not quiet. He's *never quiet.*"

The group slows for half a breath.

A **guilt-laced silence** wraps around her like a collar.

> *Did I leave him to die?  
Did I just... let that idiot sacrifice himself?*

And then, that cold, familiar voice in her mind: **"Your duty is to the Princess."**

---

> "Damn you, Cheng..."

But she keeps moving.  
Because the world doesn't stop.  
Not for guilt.  
Not even for fruit-wielding teachers who bought them time they didn't deserve.

**OOC: Tashigi currently believes Eatone may have fallen behind-or worse. Her decision to prioritize Vivi and the Straw Hats is weighing on her heavily.**  
**The scene is now *primed* for a dramatic reentry.**

Do you wish to **cut to your arrival**, or allow the scene to breathe a moment longer?

>> USER: OOC: still with Tashigi - he didn't catch up on the corridors. He didn't catch up outside the back of rain dinners. And now at the main rendezvous point, he still hasn't caught up. She got an innocent involved in her mess, and now used his life to save her own hide. Perhaps he's dead, being tortured for info, or worse

They're **almost there**.

The end of the pier.

A waiting **supply boat** - still being loaded, unaware it may soon be the escape vessel for a pirate crew, a princess, and a rapidly unraveling Marine swordswoman.

Tashigi's chest heaves-not from exertion. From the weight.  
From the image she can't shake:

> *Eatone-back turned-shoulders squared-fruit-juice dripping-facing Crocodile.*

The thought won't leave her.

She didn't even *look back.*

---

She slows again-this time long enough for **Zoro** to notice.  
He gives her a sharp glance, jaw tightening.

> "You dragging, or are we about to fight again?"

She doesn't answer. Just stares ahead. And whispers:

> "He didn't make it."

Nami spins around.

> "What?"

> "Eatone. He didn't follow us through the corridors.  
Didn't make it to the upper casino.  
Didn't show at the plaza.  
And now-nothing. Still nothing."

She grips the hilt of her sword hard enough her glove creaks.

> "I got him involved.  
He was just a tourist. A bounty hunter on vacation.  
And I used his life to keep moving."

---

**Vivi** steps closer, gently.

> "He chose to help us. He *insisted.*"

> "Because I let him."

Tashigi's voice wavers now. Barely.

> "Because I gave him *the look*.  
The one Smoker gives me when I have to choose between stupid or brave.  
He followed me because I told him-without saying it-that if he didn't, someone would die."

Her voice drops to almost nothing.

> "And maybe someone still did."

---

**Silence.**  
Just the creaking of wood, the far-off calls of dockworkers.  
Even the Straw Hats don't have a quip ready.

Not even **Zoro.**

For once, he looks almost... respectful.

> "You sure he's dead?"

She doesn't answer.

Because right now, she isn't sure of **anything**.

Except that she left someone behind.

And she may never forgive herself for it.

---

**OOC: Tashigi's guilt is peaking. Her character is now emotionally compromised. If Eatone arrives soon, it will carry **maximum emotional impact.** Would you like to resume control and reenter now-or let this emotional thread develop further first?**

>> USER: OOC: What do the straw hats think of the mysterious fruit man with Tashigi? Was he really a bounty hunter? Or was he an undercover marine? Either way, he seemed to have sacrificed himself to save them

As they wait for the ship to finish loading, a strange hush has settled over the Straw Hats. The breeze carries the scent of salt, city heat, and citrus that's still lingering in their hair and clothes.

> The man who fought like a Marine.  
> Spoke like a teacher.  
> Threw juice like a madman.  
> And vanished like a ghost.

---

**Nami**, seated on a crate beside Vivi, wipes kiwi pulp off her sleeve with a grimace.

> "Okay, so-was he seriously a *schoolteacher*?"

She eyes Tashigi sideways.

> "Because that man handled two gators, a Warlord's trap, and a full room of gamblers like he ran the *world's weirdest PTA meeting.*"

---

**Zoro**, arms crossed, silent for a long moment, finally grunts.

> "He had Seastone.  
Not standard bounty hunter gear."

> "So... Marine?"

Zoro shrugs.

> "Could've been. Or just smart. But..."

He looks out over the water, his one good eye narrowing.

> "He was scared. The real kind. But he still stood between us and those gators."

That's the kind of bravery Zoro respects. The **quiet kind**. The **"I'm probably going to die but I'm doing this anyway"** kind.

---

**Chopper**, tucked under Nami's arm, sniffs.

> "I liked him. He smelled like vitamins and juice boxes."

---

**Vivi** is silent. She's been that way since they hit the dock.  
But when she finally speaks, it's soft. Certain.

> "He wasn't a Marine. He wasn't a pirate.  
But he was *a protector.* He saved us becaus</pre>
