<pre>lainous grin.

> "*SURPRISE, WORM FOOD!*"

**Miss Merry Christmas**, the tunnel-digging menace, lands in a crouch, **clawed gloves raking** as she lunges.

And behind her, just cresting the dune with *impossibly slow momentum*...

A **man-child the size of a boulder**, hunched over, cradling a **bazooka** in his lap like a toy.

**Mr. 4.**

The bazooka opens its mouth and **barks**.

> Literally.

A cannonball sails toward you and Vivi, trailing smoke and **fur**.

> "Oh come *on*," you mutter.

---

**OOC: Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas have entered the field.**

- **Miss Merry Christmas**: Mole-Mole Fruit. High-speed tunneling, ambush specialist. High speed, mid-defense.
- **Mr. 4**: Slugger and dog-bazooka user. Extremely slow, but incredibly powerful.  
    - Dog is a gun. Gun is a dog. Logic is optional.

You are the **first line of defense**.  
No one else has noticed them yet.

---

**What do you do?**

1. {Shove Vivi out of the way, launch a juice mist shield against the cannonball.}  
2. {Spray a **stickier golden blast** at the cannonball mid-air. Try to disrupt it midflight.}  
3. {Grab Vivi and dive-use juice mist to blind the mole's follow-up attack.}  
4. {Go full offense. Baton drawn, spray first, swing next. Hold the riverbank.}  
5. {Call for backup, but act now. "WE'VE GOT COMPANY!"}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 1 - Oh shit, there was a sniper!

Crash tackle Vivi, putting her as thick of a wall of juice as I can, hoping to mitigate the explosion from the cannonball.

The cannonball rips through the shield and detonates, and I take a decent hot with my body pressed over Vivi

**Tone: Explosive Chaos | Mood: Shield and Sacrifice**

---

> *"Oh shit-there was a sniper!"*

But not a bullet.

A **cannonball.**

A **fur-covered**, barking, **explosive cannonball.**

---

You **don't hesitate.**

No time to call for help.  
No time to aim.  
No time for tactics.

Just **pure instinct.**

---

You **crash tackle Vivi**, shoulder to her ribs, arm around her waist-dragging her down with a burst of motion that blurs the sand underfoot.

> "DOWN!"

At the same time, you **flare your power**, screaming with your will.

> *Juice. Now. Thick. Heavy. Wall.*

A **wave of golden kiwi pulp erupts**, shooting up and outward between you and the oncoming blast, stretching like an amber shield.

It sizzles in the sun.  
Sticky. Dense. Viscous.

But not enough.

---

> *BOOOOOM-!!*

The cannonball **slams into the juice wall**, punching through it like wet paper-**delayed**, but not stopped.

It detonates midair, just feet from your back.

> A **flash.**  
> A **crack.**  
> A **shockwave.**

And you take it.

**Full force.**

---

The blast **rips across your body**, sending shock and fire through your back.  
Your coat **splits at the seams**.  
Your glasses are gone.  
Your skin burns.  
The sand tears at you like razors.  
But **you do not move**.

You stay over Vivi-**arms around her, head down**-as the shockwave passes.

---

When the dust clears-

> You're still breathing.

Your body **hurts like hell**.  
But **she's untouched**.

---

You grunt.

> "That's-*ugh*-gonna bruise."

Vivi blinks up at you-eyes wide with horror and disbelief.

> "Eatone... You-*you took that for me-*!"

Your breath is ragged, but you manage a smirk.

> "You're not allowed to die until your midterms are graded."

---

Behind you, Merry Christmas **howls with rage**, already preparing to burrow again.

Mr. 4 is **reloading**, the dog-gun barking with excitement.

---

**OOC: You took the blast directly.**  
- Suffered **moderate blunt and burn damage**  
- Still functional, but **winded and weakened**  
- Vivi is completely unharmed  
- Baroque agents are still active; crew is starting to notice the blast

---

**What do you do now?**

1. {Try to stand. "Blue... I might need a sec." Let her cover you while you recover.}  
2. {Drag Vivi behind cover-lay juice traps while you do. You're not done.}  
3. {Call out-"Backup! We've got tunnel freaks!"}  
4. {Prepare another shield-this time better anchored. You're not letting another hit land.}  
5. {Stay down. Let Vivi go on the offensive. You already took the hit-maybe it bought her a shot.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 4 - stagger to my feet, Spit blood out of my mouth. 

...fuck, that kinda messed me up, Blue. 

Prepare to make my stand. Hopefully not a last stand

The smoke still lingers.  
Your knees scream.  
Your lungs feel like you inhaled half the desert.  
But you're alive.

Barely.

---

> *"...Fuck."*

You spit blood into the sand.  
It hits with a wet *splack*-dark red mixing with the golden pulp that failed to save you completely.

> "That kinda messed me up, Blue."

Your voice is hoarse.  
Raw.  
But **real**.

You stagger to your feet, **shoulders rising**, body **half-bent**, arms trembling-but **up**.

> *Still between her and them.*

---

**Vivi**, still on the ground, eyes wide with shock, begins to push herself up-reaching out instinctively like she's about to *stop* you.

But she doesn't.

> She lets you stand.

---

You call the juice again.

This time not a wall, but **a barrier**.

**Wider. Heavier. Angled with intent.**

You don't *summon* it.  
You *pour it out.*

From your back, your sides, your palms, the earth around your boots-**a curtain of golden juice** begins to form.

> Not mist.  
> Not spray.  
> **A shield.**

A wide, rounded **half-dome**, three layers thick, already drying in the desert heat, forming into a **gummy, viscous shield** between you and the Baroque lunatics bearing down.

---

Merry Christmas has vanished again.

> You can hear her-*tunneling*-like a damn shark under the sand.

Mr. 4?  
He's slow.

But the **dog bazooka is already barking again**.

---

You brace.

Behind you, Vivi rises.  
Quiet. Focused.

No words.

But **she sees you now** in a way that maybe no one else ever has.

Not as a bodyguard.  
Not as a fruit-man.  
Not even as a teacher.

But as someone who's **willing to die on the riverbank for someone else's country**.

---

**OOC: Current Status**

- Moderate injury: back, shoulders, ribs bruised and partially burned  
- Standing, shield active: full frontal coverage with golden kiwi pulp dome  
- Enemy: Mr. 4 (ranged artillery), Miss Merry Christmas (underground, incoming)  
- Vivi: unharmed, poised

---

**What's your next move?**

1. {Prepare a **spike trap** in the juice shield-when Merry Christmas bursts through, she's going to regret it.}  
2. {Ready a new variant-can you generate a slicker kiwi type? Maybe blind Mr. 4's next shot.}  
3. {Whisper to Vivi: "When I say *duck*, you run." Prepare to act as decoy.}  
4. {Call out to the crew-NOW you need them. They've seen the explosion. Time for backup.}  
5. {Dig in. Say nothing. If she comes through, you're breaking her nose.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 5 - the crew's busy with their fights, but they should've heard the explosions. I trust they'll come to help when they can. In the meantime, it's just Vivi and I.

Create a disc of juice around my feet, hoping to obstruct attacks from below. Keep an eye on Mr. 4

Initiate combat! Vivi and I vs. Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas

> *"It's just you and me, Blue."*

The words are simple. Final.  
Not a speech.  
Not a call for glory.

Just fact.

You **brace your feet**, ignoring the sting in your back and ribs, and summon a new formation:

A wide, **circular disc of kiwi juice** spreads from your soles-glossy, golden, and dense.  
**A membrane layer**, like thick plexiglass made o</pre>
