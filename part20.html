<pre>ue Works Agent - Status: Disabled**
- Eyes: Blinded by acidic kiwi  
- Breathing: Labored  
- Weapon: Dropped  
- Current Action: *None. You have full control.*

Tashigi pushes herself upright, sword gripped tightly in one hand, the other holding her bruised temple.

> "Thanks. He was waiting. I didn't even hear him."

She eyes the **Seastone tip** of your baton.

> "That's not standard bounty hunter issue. You really a teacher?"

> *Only you answer that.*

---

**📝 Combat Update:**
- One **hostile down**
- **Vent route cleared**
- Corridor now stable
- Tashigi is injured, but standing
- You are now an *active ally* in Marine eyes

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Tie the agent up. Begin questioning him with Tashigi. Fast and dirty.}
2. {Ask Tashigi what her mission is down here. You've earned a few answers.}
3. {Move further in. You've got momentum, and Baroque Works knows *something* went wrong.}
4. {Call your Marine contact-Enzo. Time to let someone know what you've walked into.}
5. {Use kiwi juice to lock the ceiling vent and reinforce the corridor behind you. No more surprises.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 5 - Lay more Kiwi juice. Then knock the Agent out for good measure.

Don't ask me about the price on the baton. I probably could've bought a small house in the east blue with it. You okay, ma'am?

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 5 Selected - "Seal the route, clean the mess. Safety first, sass second."**  
**🎭 Tone: Duty Over Drama | Mood: Collected, Gritty Professionalism**  
**🎲 Juice-Lock Deployment - (Eatone +2 Devil Fruit Control, +1 Situational Awareness) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 KO Roll - Baton Strike (+2 Surprise, +1 Blinded Target) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎯 Outcome: You lock the corridor down tight, then send the agent to dreamland. Tashigi now sees you as an asset.**

---

You turn slightly, extend your hand again, and release a controlled stream of kiwi juice **along the ceiling vent's rim**, hardening it mid-flow with a practiced flick of your wrist. The juice thickens, seals, and **locks the vent** shut in a sticky lattice of hardened pulp and acidic residue.

> *If anyone else wants to drop in uninvited, they're going to taste regret first.*

Satisfied, you turn back to the twitching Baroque Works agent, still groaning, mask half-melted and soaked in juice. He manages a weak, gurgled:

> "Gh-kkk... who the hell are y-"

> **CRACK.**

You don't answer.  
You just step in and deliver a precise, quick baton strike to the **side of the head**.  
**Non-lethal. Blunt. Clinical.**

He slumps instantly.  
**Unconscious.**

You kneel beside him, checking his pulse-strong but out cold. You grab his knife and toss it aside, noting its make: **obsidian-coated, finely balanced, clearly custom.** You keep it.

> **[+1 Baroque Dagger - Non-standard issue. Lightweight. Possibly poisoned.]**

Then, you look to Tashigi as you holster your baton again with a sigh.

> "Don't ask me about the price on the baton.  
I could've bought a small house in the East Blue with it. Maybe even a yard."

She laughs softly-short and sharp, like she's still catching her breath.

> "That's... more than I paid for my sword."  
She touches her temple again, winces.

> "I'm okay. Took a hard elbow to the head and rolled into a wall. Nothing's broken. Just rattled.  
I owe you one, Cheng."

She pauses, then corrects herself:

> "Eatone."

You offer a nod.

> "You sure you're good to keep going, ma'am?"

She wipes some blood from her eyebrow and squares her shoulders.

> "If I wasn't, I wouldn't be here."

She looks down at the unconscious agent.

> "But now we know for sure: this corridor's compromised. Baroque Works is *inside* Rain Dinners' internal systems.  
They're not just watching-they're *moving things.*"

**📝 Updates:**

- **Vent locked. No more surprise drops.**  
- **Baroque Agent KO'd** - Can be interrogated later.  
- **Tashigi remains active, but injured** - trusts you, defers tactically.  
- **Inventory Updated** - Baroque Dagger acquired.  
- **Status: Clean sweep. You are now a fully embedded ally in this Marine op.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Move forward with Tashigi. Push deeper into Rain Dinners' inner workings.}
2. {Ask what she knows about Baroque Works. You've earned some answers.}
3. {Interrogate the downed agent briefly before continuing. Fast questions, quick gain.}
4. {Use your juice to reinforce this position. Turn it into a fallback point if things go south.}
5. {Contact Enzo. Tell him exactly what's happening-and ask if this dagger matches anything known.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option X - That Smoker guy, he's your CO, right? You able to get in contact with him? Whatever's going on here, seems out of my pay grade. Maybe out of both our pay grades.

OOC: Smoker has likely been captured in the trap already

OOC: I have a positive disposition to the Marines

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option X Selected - "Smoker, right? Might be time to phone the boss."**  
**🎭 Tone: Professional Concern | Disposition: Respectful Ally of the Law**  
**🎲 Insight Roll - (Eatone +2 Professional Instinct, +1 Marine Familiarity) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**🎲 Tashigi's Reaction - (+2 Respect for Transparency, -1 Worry Over Smoker's Status) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**🎯 Outcome: You voice the right concern at the right time-Tashigi is honest with you. She tries to reach Smoker... but something's wrong.**

---

You nudge the unconscious agent with your boot-just a tap, to make sure he's not faking a nap-then glance toward the deeper shadows of the corridor.

> "That Smoker guy," you say quietly, turning to Tashigi,  
> "he's your CO, right?"

She nods, standing straighter at the mention of his name, as if reflexively steeling herself.

> "You able to get in contact with him?  
Because... whatever's going on here-it's *above my grade*. Might be above *both* of ours."

She exhales slowly, wiping more blood off her cheek with the cuff of her coat.

> "Yeah. It is."

She pulls a **small Den Den Mushi** from her inside jacket pocket-a different one than before. **Direct line.** You catch a faint glimpse of a scratched "S" engraved in the casing.

She taps it awake.

> **"Captain Smoker, this is Tashigi. Situation update: hostile Baroque Works agents active in casino interior. Requesting sitrep-Captain, come in."**

Silence.

She tries again.

> "Captain?  
Smoker, this is Tashigi. I'm with a freelance ally. We've got a downed agent, compromised corridors, and a high likelihood of organized infiltration. Respond."

Still nothing.

The Den Den Mushi blinks... then frowns.  
Eyes closed.

> "That's not signal loss," she mutters, lowering it slightly.  
> "That's... severed connection. He's *offline.*"

You frown.

> "Could mean a lot of things."

She nods grimly.

> "But when it comes to Smoker?  
*It never means something good.*"

**OOC Context Crosscheck:**  
Smoker, at this point in canon, **has just been captured** along with the Straw Hats in **Crocodile's trap beneath Rain Dinners**.  
He is inside the **Seastone cage** suspended above the Banana Gator pit.  
He's **off-grid.**

---

**📝 Updates:**

- Smoker **cannot be contacted**. Likely captured.  
- Tashigi is now aware her superior is missing. She will begin shifting into **autonomous Marine op mode**.  
- You are now functioning as her **partner in field assessment**-even without official rank.

---

She lowers the Den Den Mushi, face hardening.

> "That's it then. We're on our own."  
> "We keep moving. Find out how deep this hole goes-and figure out if your lady in blue is still ahead of us... or already fallen in."

She starts walking again, slower now, hand near her sword.

> "You still with me, teacher?"

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {"Yeah. Let's move." Continue with Tashigi deeper into the lower Rain Dinners complex.}
2. {"Wait. Let's interrogate this guy while we've got the chance." Try to get info while Tashigi still watches your</pre>
