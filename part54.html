<pre>'s extended limb, using it as a pivot, and **flings herself toward Miss Merry Christmas**-wounded arm or not, blade flashing.

---

**Miss Merry Christmas**, crawling from the collapsed dune, turns just in time to see a **ring of sharpened wire** wrap around her **midsection**-

> *"NO NO NO-"*

And Vivi **pulls.**

The Baroque agent hits the sand with a muffled *oof*, groaning.

Not dead.

But **done.**

---

**Meanwhile, Mr. 4 lines up one more shot.**

He doesn't understand what's happening.  
He's never had to.

He pulls the trigger-

> *BARK-* *BOOM-*

The cannonball sails-  
But **the elemental is already there.**

It **spins** its body, arm forming into a massive paddle, and **baseball bats** the shot back into the dunes like a home run made of citrus and spite.

> *KA-BOOM!!*

A crater forms.  
Sand rains like confetti.

Mr. 4 stares, slack-jawed, and finally speaks:

> "Uh oh."

A shadow looms over him.

**Sanji**, landing like a dancer made of rage, foot raised high, voice cold:

> "That's for the lady."

> *CRACK-!!*

Mr. 4 crumples like a broken chair.

---

**Across the dunes...**

**Tashigi freezes.**

She watches the emerald titan rear up, its body flickering with unnatural citrus light, and sees the battered man in the sand-**you**-grinning like a madman through blood and bruises.

> *He's not done.*  
> *He won't ever be done until she's safe.*  
> *And that thing-whatever it is-it's not just power.*

> *It's protection.*  
> *Made flesh.*

---

Her knuckles whiten around her sword.

And for the first time, **she sees you not as a liability... but as a peer.**

---

**OOC: The immediate battle is over.  
Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas are defeated.  
Vivi stands, wounded but alive.  
You remain conscious, barely.  
The elemental persists-standing sentinel over its ward.**

---

**What do you do?**

1. {Let yourself pass out. You've done enough.}  
2. {Whisper to Vivi. "Told you... someone had to watch the kids."}  
3. {Try to sit up, give the Kiwicher one final order before the lights go out.}  
4. {Smile up at the sky. "I'm never going on vacation again."}  
5. {Call out. "Is class dismissed yet...?"}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your closing beat.}

>> USER: Option 2 - I give one final grin at Vivi, before the adrenaline, blood loss, and concussion catch up. I pass out, the kiwi elemental dispersing into a splashy puddle 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - Class Dismissed]**  
**Scene: End of the Lesson | Tone: Quiet Collapse | Mood: Earned Rest**

---

You lie there, broken but not bowed, ribs aching with every shallow breath.  
You feel your vision fading-colors softening, the world slowing.

But before the dark swallows you completely, you manage to turn your head just enough to meet her gaze.

---

**Vivi**, breathing heavy, arm trembling from the strain of her injuries, looks back at you-

And sees your face, bruised and bloodied, pull into one final, defiant grin.

> "Told you..."  
> "Someone had to watch the kids..."

---

And then-

You exhale.

Your head slumps to the side.

The light behind your eyes dims-

---

And the **Kiwi elemental** flickers.  
Pulses once.

And with a soft, citrusy *splash*-  
It bursts apart into harmless green mist, **vanishing** into the sand.

---

**Vivi stares at the spot it stood.**

Hands shaking.

Heart pounding.

> And then she drops to her knees beside you.

"*He's breathing,*" she calls hoarsely. "*He's still breathing...*"

---

**Tashigi arrives moments later, blade sheathed, eyes wide.  
Zoro follows. Sanji. Nami. Luffy.**

They see the wreckage, the puddles of strange green liquid, the faint scent of tropical fruit on the wind.

And you.

Collapsed.  
Still.  
Smiling.

---

**Luffy tilts his head.**

> "He's kinda weird," he mutters.

**Zoro grunts.** "Tough, though."

**Chopper drops beside you, already working.**  
**Nami sighs.** "Don't die, dumbass. You still owe me drinks for that bet."

---

And **Vivi**, quietly brushing dirt off your brow, whispers:

> "Thank you...  
Eatone-sensei."

---

**OOC: You are unconscious.  
You have survived.  
And you've left behind more than bruises.**

You've left behind **a legend.**

**[Scene End]**  
**XP Earned: Massive.  
Bond Progress: Vivi, Tashigi ++

Would you like to continue to the **aftermath scene aboard the ship**... or rest for now?

>> USER: OOC: Vivi has called for the royal ducks to get them through the desert, but they're still on their way. In the meantime, begin the post battle scene 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Post-Battle Scene - Sandora Riverbank: Wounds, Reflection, and the Waiting Sun]**  
**Scene Title: "Before the Ducks Arrive"**  
**Tone: Wounded Stillness | Mood: Healing in the Wake of Fury**

The battlefield is quiet now.

The sand, once churned with the chaos of Baroque agents and cannon fire, is mostly still-broken only by the occasional gust of wind and the soft groans of the injured. Smoke drifts lazily toward the horizon, curling above craters and crushed dunes like incense curling toward the heavens.

**Mr. 4** lies unmoving in the crater his own cannonball helped carve.  
**Miss Merry Christmas** is tangled half in her own cloak, bound by slashing wires.  
**Bon Clay**, still glued to the earth, is loudly complaining about sand in uncomfortable places.

---

**You**, Eatone Cheng, are unconscious-yet **stable**-lying atop a folded cloak that someone (likely **Vivi**) placed beneath your head.  
Chopper is already at work, carefully patching burns, sealing cuts, and whispering reassurances to himself about "cool, responsible adults being way too reckless."

Beside you, **Vivi sits cross-legged**, arm freshly bandaged, lips pressed in thought.  
She hasn't moved more than a foot from you since you passed out.

---

> "The ducks should be here within the hour," she says quietly, more to herself than anyone.

---

Not far off, **Tashigi** stands alone.

Her hand rests on the hilt of her sword, but her gaze is fixed-sharp, almost haunted-on the puddle where your elemental once stood.

She hasn't spoken much since the fighting ended.

But every now and then...  
She glances at you.

And looks away.

Like someone still processing what she just witnessed.

---

The rest of the Straw Hats are licking their wounds in their own fashion:

- **Zoro** is drinking something suspicious from a waterskin.  
- **Sanji** is cooking an absurdly fancy field-ration sandwich.  
- **Usopp** is monologuing to the wind about how he *absolutely* had it handled.  
- **Nami** is calculating potential storm angles for a quick duck-assisted escape.  
- **Luffy**, sitting beside the water, stares at the horizon like it personally insulted him.

---

The **mood** is exhausted.  
But... safe.  
For now.

---

**OOC: You are currently unconscious, but may soon awaken.  
Vivi is nearby. The crew is waiting. The royal Super Spot-Billed Ducks are en route.**

Would you like to begin the **waking scene**, or allow more time to pass and pick up during the next travel leg across the desert?

>> USER: OOC: I'm passed out like a sleepy boi

OOC; Tashigi and Vivi may interact

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora Riverbank - Post-Battle, Pre-Ducks]**  
**Scene: "He Shouldn't Be Here"**  
**Tone: Quiet Emotion | Mood: Unspoken Guilt and Unseen Gratitude**

The sun inches lower, stretching long shadows over the dunes.

**Eatone** lies still, pale and bandaged. His back rises and falls in shallow rhythm. His arms twitch sometimes in unconscious memory of the fight.

Near him, **Vivi** runs a cloth gently across his forehead, dabbing away crusted sand. Her peacock slashers lie discarded beside her, the wires slack.

Her eyes aren't on the wounds.

They're on his face.

---

> "He shouldn't be here."

The voice comes from behind her-measured, quiet, with the sharp edge of someone who has no idea how to say what they're thin</pre>
