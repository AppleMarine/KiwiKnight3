<pre>y.

> "Rank doesn't always mean winning, you know. I once heard about a **Commodore in the East Blue** who got annihilated by some pirates at the **Conomi Islands**."

Tashigi glances at you.

> "Arlong."

You nod.

> "That's the one. Guy got chewed up by a shark-man and his goons. Rank meant nothing when the fight came."

You give her a sidelong glance.

> "But you? You *stood* against a Warlord with a sword and your spine. That's more than a title. That's character."

---

Tashigi doesn't respond for a long moment.

Then-quietly:

> "I'm starting to understand that."

And she means it.

**[Mission Start: Desert Remnant Sweep]**  
**Location: Sandstone Quarry, Southern Basin**  
**Team: You, Tashigi, 2 Royal Guards**  
**Objective: Investigate movement at former Baroque supply cache. Engage only if necessary.**

**Gear Acquired:**
- Desert Cloak (+ minor sun resistance)  
- Reinforced travel vest (+1 to minor wound threshold)  
- Satchel with: 1 health poultice, 1 desert ration, 1 juice stabilizing canteen  
- Loaned palace comm shell (short-range Den Den Mushi, 2 km effective)

---

As the gates open, and you begin your ride across the southern trail, dust trailing behind your boots like ghostly echoes of a war barely ended-

You realize something.

You're not chasing peace anymore.

You're helping build it.

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Talk with the guards en route-learn more about recent sightings.}  
2. {Walk in silence. Focus. Feel the land. Let the tension build naturally.}  
3. {Deploy a mini Kiwi scout down the ridge when the quarry nears. Risk early detection.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - Shoot the shit with the guards. Talking about worming my way through alleys during the final battle.

The four of you march in a loose column, the **sun flaring off the dunes** like a furnace full of mirages. Your cloak flaps lightly in the breeze, your boots crunch grit beneath. Tashigi walks ahead with the calm, unreadable face of someone who's keeping her mind sharp-blade ready to draw at a moment's notice.

But the **two guards**, a pair of young royal infantrymen named **Jalim and Mikk**, trail just a few paces back.

They whisper for a while.

Until one finally blurts:

> "Hey, sir-*Consultant*, I mean-are the rumors true?"

You turn, raising an eyebrow.

> "Which rumors?"

Jalim leans forward with wide eyes.

> "The ones where you turned into a giant... *juice dragon* during the final battle! They said you swam through a puddle like a fish and exploded out of a vent!"

Mikk elbows him.

> "No, idiot, that was Snack Pack-the Bananagator he *tamed*. Get it right."

---

You give a long sigh. And then start **grinning**.

> "Alright, alright, settle down. I'll tell you how it happened."

---

As the sun climbs and the trail winds toward the first crumbling ridge of the **old sandstone basin**, you regale the guards with your gloriously exaggerated tale:

- **You**, crawling through alleys like a **greased-up predator**, leaving trails of *citrus doom* behind you.
- The **concussive headbutt** into a Baroque agent's plated chest, which you dramatically refer to as *"Kiwi Blitzkrieg."*
- The **Emerald Titan** erupting from a pool of fruit and desperation at the 5-minute mark-*"an elemental of tropical vengeance,"* you explain, hands waving for dramatic effect.
- And your *strategic* napping that "lured Crocodile into a false sense of victory."

---

By the end, both guards are *howling*, Mikk trying not to trip over his own feet.

Tashigi, from the front, calls back without turning:

> "You forgot the part where you flopped over Vivi's lap and muttered about Snack Pack in your sleep."

You pause.

> "That was a *tactical morale reset.*"

---

Jalim pipes up.

> "Sir, if I die today, I just want to say I'm glad I got to patrol with the Sticky Knight of Alubarna."

You hold up a hand.

> "Sticky *Consultant*, thank you."

---

The tone shifts as you reach the **crest of the ridge**, and the **quarry stretches below you**: stone ruins, a cracked supply depot, faded Baroque markings barely visible on the sandstone.

Everything's quiet. Too quiet.

---

**OOC: Morale boost achieved. Guards are loyal, in good spirits.**  
You may gain a small bonus to rolls involving teamwork or protection of the guards.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Deploy Kiwi Scout for a look inside the depot before descending.}  
2. {Send one guard around the flank while you descend with the rest.}  
3. {Enter quietly as a group-slow, deliberate, minimize noise.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - hold on Tashigi-chan. Check this out.

---

You hold up a hand as the wind tugs at your cloak.

> "Hold up, Tashigi-chan. You're about to witness some *real* tactical innovation."

She pauses mid-step, turning with a single arched eyebrow.

> "If this ends with you falling down the hill again, I'm drawing my sword."

You grin and step toward the edge of the ridge, crouching down as you draw moisture from your palm. The air hisses slightly as **a translucent puddle of green-yellow kiwi juice** spreads across the dusty stone beneath you.

You narrow your eyes.

Focus.

---

> "Operation: Kiwi Recon engaged."

---

**The puddle ripples-then coils upward into a tiny, gelatinous figure.**  
Two arms. A bulbous upper body. No legs, but a trail like a snail behind it.  
Eyes? Technically, no. But you **will** it to know where to go.

It gives you a little *splurt*.

> "That's Kiwi Scout 1," you say to the others, wiping your hands.  
> "He's a reconnaissance specialist. Probably unionized."

Jalim and Mikk exchange stunned glances. One whispers, "...he's *so* small."

> "He's proud," you reply.

---

You gently place him at the edge of a broken slope leading into the depot's ruins.

He oozes down, silently, his **slick trail of juice hidden in the color of the sand.**

---

**OOC: SCOUT DEPLOYED.**

**Recon Roll (Kiwi Scout Stealth & Sensory Relay)**  
- Kiwi Scout Stealth: (1d20+2) → **17 + 2 = 19**  
- Enemy Perception: (1d20+1) → **4 + 1 = 5**

---

**SUCCESS.**

---

You close your eyes as the **sensation of the scout's movement pulses through your palm**-soft vibrations, like gentle footfalls echoed through syrup.

Inside the depot... it's **quiet. But not empty.**

You feel:

- Two heat signatures-human. One moving. One seated.  
- Scattered crates, likely opened recently.  
- A faint, sharp smell-like **oiled steel and smoked parchment. Gunpowder? Traps?**  
- The **distinct rumble of a Den Den Mushi**, either active or recently used.

---

> "There are at least two people in there," you mutter.  
> "One pacing. One sitting, probably watching. Doesn't feel like they're panicking."

Tashigi kneels beside you, listening closely.

> "Could be leadership. Or a holdout cell."

> "They cracked some of the old supply crates. There's... weapon scent. Could be prepping something nasty."

---

You look up at the rest of the team.

> "They haven't noticed us yet. If we want to move, we move smart."

---

**OOC: Excellent scout read. Surprise round available if you choose to engage.**

Would you like to:

1. {Send Tashigi and a guard to circle around while you and the second guard breach from above.}  
2. {Attempt to intercept the Den Den Mushi-find out who they were talking to before they finish.}  
3. {Engage all together-fast and overwhelming, try to subdue before they react.}

>> USER: ​Option 3 - you think we should call for backup? I recall the kiwi scout, and grow it near human size
