<pre> her.}
4. {Go to the staff corridor now. Quietly. Carefully. If it's bad, she'll need help faster than ten minutes.}
5. {Contact Enzo again. You have a name, a title, and a possible warlord's base of operations.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 1 - Return to the Bananagator pens, near the corridor. Ready to respond in 10 minutes. Or if I hear explosions.

Wave to the crowd as I return, and clink glasses with my newfound friends.

Observe. What did the guard next to the corridor do when Tashigi approached?

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected - "Ten-minute countdown. If there's screaming, I'm sprinting."**  
**🎭 Tone: Watchful Guest | Internal Readiness: Battle-On-A-Hair-Trigger**  
**🎲 Stealth Return Roll - (Eatone +2 Subtle, +1 Social Camouflage, +1 Route Familiarity) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Observation Roll - (Eatone +2 Careful, +1 Juice-Sense, +1 Experience Watching Shady Adults at School Events) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**✅ Outcome: You return unnoticed, perfectly reintegrate into the crowd, and *notice everything.*

---

You wait ten seconds after Tashigi disappears-*just enough time to let the quiet hang like a held breath.*

Then, you turn and **casually retrace your path** back toward the casino floor, daiquiri still in hand, stride even, gaze soft. No one gives you a second look. **You're Cheng. The daiquiri king. Gator god. Room 703.**

As you step through the archway into the familiar chaos of the **Banana Gator RumbleDome**, the crowd is still riding the high of your last toast. The servers have brought out **free snack trays** in your honor. Someone's fashioned a **Snack Pack mask out of cocktail napkins**.

> "Heyyy, he's back!"  
> "CHENG! GATOR KING!"

You wave, grin, and clink glasses with two enthusiastic fans-one wearing a gator tail hat, the other just **vibing way too hard to flute jazz.**

You gently **steer yourself to a small table** near the arena's edge-specifically, one with **full line-of-sight** to the **Staff Only corridor**.

---

### **Your Eyes Lock On the Guard**

He's still there.  
Same stance.  
Still looking too neutral.  
Still wearing no name tag.  
Still pretending to be invisible-but standing **like someone trained to fight.**

But here's what you **saw earlier**, now with fresh clarity:

> When Tashigi approached the corridor...  
> **He didn't stop her.**  
> He *didn't even move.*  
> No hand to a comm, no "may I help you," no nothing.

He saw her coming. Saw the **Marine coat**, saw the **sword**, saw the **clearly non-tourist** energy-and chose to look away.

> Which means either:
- He didn't recognize her and is criminally undertrained (unlikely).
- He **was told to let her pass**.
- Or **he was told not to interfere with anyone "official looking."**

You also notice: the **door she went through hasn't opened since.**

---

**📝 Time Check:**

- Tashigi went in **less than two minutes ago**.
- You are seated, fully reabsorbed into the crowd.
- The corridor is still quiet. Still guarded. Still *wrong.*

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Wait the full ten minutes. No action unless you hear something. Let the plan play out.}
2. {Start a distraction if needed-something to make the guard abandon post or react. Could be a false "Gator Emergency."}
3. {Leave a Kiwi juice trail from the corridor into the hallway, so you can follow it faster later. Subtle prep.}
4. {Approach the guard under the guise of casual conversation. Feel him out-see if he's Baroque Works.}
5. {Use one of your new fans. Convince them to ask the guard "where the VIP restroom is" as a probe.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 4 - I offer the guard a drink. Hey, from one working man to another, appreciate you keeping us safe.

OOC: I know nothing about Baroque works

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 4 Selected - "Hey, man. Just keeping the vibes alive."**  
**🎭 Tone: Friendly Guest | No Suspicion, Just Politeness | Hidden Probe Under Cover of Kindness**  
**🎲 Social Approach Roll - (Eatone +2 Rapport, +1 High Roller Aura, +1 No Suspicion of Baroque Works) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Guard's Reaction - (Trained +2, But Not Expecting Kindness -1) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**✅ Outcome: You disarm him with charm. He remains professional, but lets a *few things* slip.**

---

You swirl the last inch of your daiquiri and walk toward the corridor casually, like you're just stretching your legs before betting another thousand on your semi-possessed gator.

The guard doesn't react as you approach. Doesn't twitch, doesn't flinch. Just watches you with the same **calm stare you've seen on exasperated substitute teachers** trying to grade essays during a school fire drill.

You stop beside him-just enough distance not to crowd.

> "Hey," you say lightly.  
> "From one working man to another-appreciate you keeping us safe out here."

You offer the drink-not aggressively. Just... a friendly gesture from a guy with extra vintage and too much attention.

For a moment, he says nothing.

Then:

> "Appreciate that, sir. But I don't drink on post."

His voice is polite. Neutral. But you catch the **slight pause before "sir."** Like he's choosing that word carefully. Like he's trained to.

He nods toward the tank, where **Snack Pack** is now getting a shoulder massage from an arena handler.

> "You've got the floor lit up tonight. Don't see many people treat staff with respect like that."

You keep the conversation casual.

> "Eh, it's just a vacation for me. School's out. Nice room, good drinks, freakishly athletic reptiles. What's not to love?"

A tiny smile flickers across his face. You decide to test the waters.

> "So what's back there, anyway?" you nod at the staff corridor.  
> "Employee lounge? Secret slot machines? Gator nap room?"

His response is **quick**, smooth-but *too rehearsed*.

> "Just back-of-house logistics, sir. Tank access, kitchen intake, maintenance. Nothing for guests."

> "Mmh." You take a sip.  
> "Saw someone go in earlier. Long blue hair. Didn't look like staff."

> "...Probably security clearance. Some VIPs bring personal assistants. Escorts. Stylists."

Another smooth lie. But now you're listening closer.

He shifts his stance slightly, hand resting near his hip-not threateningly, just **habitually**, like there's something holstered there.

**Not a weapon. A Den Den Mushi. A communicator.**

---

**📝 What You've Learned:**

- He's **not a casino employee**. Too rigid. Too professional.  
- He **recognized Tashigi as someone important**-but let her through without orders.
- The corridor leads to **more than just kitchens.** Possibly **Rain Dinners' internal control zone**.
- He's not aggressive. You aren't considered a threat. But if you were *suspicious*, he'd likely act fast.
- You're **earning trust**-and that means opportunity.

---

**Time Check: 4 Minutes Since Tashigi Entered**  
**Corridor: Quiet. Door: Still Closed.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Continue the small talk. See if you can get his name, origin, or slip about his *real* employer.}
2. {Ask him what he thinks of the guy in charge here-"Croco? I heard he's a war hero or something?" See how he reacts.}
3. {Leave a tiny juice marker on his coat hem or boot. If he moves, you'll know.}
4. {Return to your table. Let him forget you. Watch for movement.}
5. {Ask if staff ever let VIP guests tour the "logistics" area. Play dumb. Maybe get an invite.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 2 - Hey, how about I get you a drink when you get off shift then? I'm sure you've got stories to share. I know I do.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 2 Selected - "I'll toast you later, friend. Off the clock."**  
**🎭 Tone: Charismatic, Disarming, *Strategic Friendship Offer***  
**🎲 Social Roll - (Eatone +2 Rapport, +1 Casual Trust Offer, +1 ‘Not Threatening' Aura) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Guard's Response Roll - (Trained +1, Socially Underequipped -1) = Result: 0 [Mediocre]**  
**✅ Outcome: You catch him off guard, ease his stance, and learn</pre>
