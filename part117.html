<pre>ce **light, knees bent**, the way those half-faded library books always said to.

Across from you, **Tashigi's sword dips**, just slightly-**the opening feint of a swordswoman who doesn't need to win, but can't *not* fight seriously.**

---

You take a breath.

> *Observe. Read. Adapt.*

You may be outmatched-but you're a teacher.

You know how to **watch**.

---

**Combat Roll (Defense-Focused)**
- Tashigi: (1d20+8) → **17 + 8 = 25**
- You: (1d20+2) → **4 + 2 = 6**

---

**The first strike is fast.**

**Too fast.**

You *barely* see the blade move-her bokken whips through the air and cracks **clean across your extended baton**, sending a jolt through your arms that rattles your teeth and unbalances your stance.

Your counter comes too slow-she sidesteps, spins, and **taps you once on the shoulder**, then flicks your calf on the follow-through.

---

> "Point," she says. Crisp. Focused.

You stumble back into your stance, blinking.

> "Okay, okay-didn't think you were gonna go full demo reel from the start."

---

She exhales slowly.

> "You told me you wanted to learn."

---

**Second Exchange - You Adjust**

You lower your center of gravity, adjust your grip.

She circles, testing.

You sidestep one lunge, then barely dodge a sweeping horizontal slash-her form textbook, **almost too clean** to counter.

> *She fights like she's always being judged.*

---

**Combat Roll (Adaptation Attempt)**
- Tashigi: (1d20+7) → **14 + 7 = 21**
- You: (1d20+3) → **11 + 3 = 14**

---

You manage to block two strikes-not gracefully, but with **tenacity**. She nods once, approving.

But when you go for a counter, you're just half a beat slow-her sword taps your hand, *pop*, then your knee, *tap*, and with a half-spin she brings the wooden blade up just under your chin.

She doesn't swing.

She just holds it there.

---

> "Point."

She lowers it gently.

> "And you'd be dead."

---

You huff.

> "Not if I threw juice in your eyes."

She smirks. Doesn't disagree.

---

**A few meters away, Vivi winces sympathetically... and then scribbles something down in a notebook.**  
(She might be rating you. She might be doodling Snack Pack again.)

---

You ready yourself.

Tashigi lifts her blade again.

There's no mockery in her expression.  
No ego.

Only respect.

Because even if you're **getting your arse handed to you**, you're **not giving up**.

And that?

Counts for more than points.

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Attempt one big surprise maneuver-something creative, chaotic, possibly humiliating.}  
2. {Shift to a purely evasive style-see how long you can survive.}  
3. {Call it here, respectfully. Ask for critique-after all, you're here to learn.}

>> USER: ​Option 2 - Maybe I need faster footwork 

OOC: combat rolls remain catastrophically against me, likely for the entirety of the whole spar

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Training Yard - Sparring Match, Round Three]**  
**Scene: "The Art of Not Dying (Immediately)"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Scrappy | Mood: Dogged, Determined, Mostly Dignified**

---

You adjust your stance.

Not lower. Not tighter.  
**Looser. Lighter. Ready to move.**

If you can't win, **maybe you can last.**

> "Alright," you mutter, adjusting your footing in the sand.  
> "Let's see how long I can run from judgment."

---

Tashigi narrows her eyes.

> "You're not planning to fight?"

You grin.

> "I'm planning to survive. Different martial art."

---

She exhales. And lunges.

---

**Combat Roll - Evasion Mode Activated**  
- Tashigi: (1d20+8) → **19 + 8 = 27**  
- You: (1d20+4) → **7 + 4 = 11**

---

**First pass:**

You dodge left.  
She's already there.

Her bokken taps your side *twice*, then your shoulder as you pivot away.

You roll, and sand fills your collar.  
A move so ungraceful it loops back into respectable.

---

> "Point," she says.

You grunt.

> "Warmup round."

---

**Second pass:**

You sprint.

Not toward her-*around* her.  
Wide circles. Kicking up sand.

She watches, amused.

Then?

She darts in like a hawk.

---

**Combat Roll - Endurance Attempt**
- Tashigi: (1d20+6) → **13 + 6 = 19**
- You: (1d20+4) → **13 + 4 = 17**

---

This time, you *barely* escape the first two strikes.  
You duck one.  
Trip over your own coat.

*BUT YOU RECOVER.*

Your baton swipes wildly-accidentally deflecting her blade with a **loud CLACK**, purely from falling sideways.

---

Tashigi halts, blinking.  
Not hurt. Just stunned.

> "...Did you just parry by collapsing?"

You pant.

> "Advanced technique. Taught to me by Lady Riko-sensei in the ‘Avoid the Hip Fracture' kata."

---

A laugh.  
Short. Sharp.  
But real.

Tashigi steps back, sword down.

> "You're a disaster."

You lean on your baton.

> "I am a **resilient** disaster."

---

**Off to the side, Vivi applauds softly.**  
Like a parent watching a kindergartener dodge their first punch.

You give a little bow.  
Fall over slightly mid-bow.

Recover. Dignity intact (mostly).

---

**OOC: You did not win. Not even close.  
But you earned her respect. And the audience's.**

Sometimes surviving long enough to get hit *less* is still a win.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Call it here and ask for pointers. A real student moment.}  
2. {Suggest another round-with some very minor fruit assistance, maybe?}  
3. {Collapse dramatically and ask for water and possibly a medal.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - Genuinely compliment Tashigi's skills 
I look over at the wall at Vivi. You enjoy watching Marine brutality, blue?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Training Yard - Post-Sparring Cooldown]**  
**Scene: "Sword, Sweat, and Sincere Words"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Respectful | Mood: Mutual Admiration, Playful Recovery**

---

You drop to one knee-half to catch your breath, half because the last spin move you attempted pulled a muscle that hasn't been named in medical literature yet.

You look up at Tashigi, still holding her practice blade in a loose grip, posture clean, hair only *slightly* mussed.

> "You're good."

You mean it. There's no cheek, no sarcasm.  
Just quiet honesty, with a wheeze of effort.

> "Like, *really* good. The kind of good that makes me glad we're on the same side of the warlord-chopping equation."

---

Tashigi's brow lifts slightly.

> "You're not so bad yourself," she replies.

Then smirks.

> "I've never seen someone dodge with such... commitment to panic."

You grin, shaking out your wrist.

> "Panic is a valid martial art."

---

You tilt your head toward the wall where **Vivi's blue hair peeks out like a spy in training**, her notebook now closed, her expression unreadable-but her amusement **palpable**.

You raise your voice just enough to carry.

> "You enjoy watching Marine brutality, Blue?"

Her head pokes out further.  
She does not look even remotely sorry.

> "Only when it's well-earned," she says with a laugh.  
> "Besides-watching you get *absolutely demolished* was oddly therapeutic."

---

You fake a wounded gasp.

> "You hear that, Tashigi-chan? No appreciation for finesse. Not even for my advanced defensive rolling technique."

> "I call it the Juicy Evasion Spiral."

---

Tashigi walks over, offers you a hand.

You take it-only a little sore-and she hauls you to your feet.

> "Same time next week?" she asks.

You dust yourself off.

> "Sure. And maybe next time, I'll last more than... what was that, five minutes?"

She considers.

> "Six. If we count the collapse."

You sigh.

> "I'll take it."

---

**OOC:**

- Tashigi's respect for you has **ticked up** slightly. Not because you fought well-but because you *wanted to learn*.  
- Vivi has now seen you get beaten into the sand and still crack jokes. That matters to her more than heroics ever did.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Walk with Tashigi to breakfast-perhaps Vivi joins.}  
2. {Check in with Smoker. He may have an errand or update for you.}  
3. {Head to the gardens for a breath of quiet, after all that rolling.}
