<pre>uch more... to give..."

You reach forward, blindly, your hand **fumbling in the air**.

Vivi sees it first-her instincts kick in.

She reaches down, **grabs your hand**, clutches it tight.

> "I've got you. You're not going anywhere."

Tashigi presses her palm to your forehead, trying to stabilize you, even as your skin grows cold.

---

> "Don't let him die here," she whispers.  
> "*Don't let this be his last class.*"

---

Above, the **elemental lurches.**

It slows-

Then stops-

Then trembles-

---

And its **head turns**.

Toward you.

Toward your flickering life.

Its creator.

---

The glow in its chest **brightens**.

Its movements **change**.

No longer sluggish, lumbering. No longer trying to bludgeon Crocodile into submission-

Instead, it **flickers**-**pressurizes**-

**Concentrates.**

---

It looks at **Luffy**, slick with juice.  
It looks at **Crocodile**, smug, confident, *barely wet enough to be annoying.*

And the elemental **roars again**-

But this time it's not a war cry.

It's a **warning.**

---

OOC:  
- Your unconscious plea and Vivi's presence have **tethered you to consciousness**-for now.  
- The elemental has recognized your weakness, and is about to make a **choice.**  
- Luffy is primed. Crocodile is still slippery-but vulnerable, if timed right.  
- **Snack Pack's memory has been honored.**

Would you like the elemental to:

1. {Transfer its remaining moisture and Hero Water into Luffy-all in, one chance.}  
2. {Perform a final attack-pin or bind Crocodile to give Luffy a guaranteed hit.}  
3. {Disperse in an explosion of pressurized juice, soaking the field-maximizing Luffy's impact.}

>> USER: ​Option X - snack pack isn't enough. Continue losing more and more consciousness

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Final Descent]**  
**Scene: "A Teacher's Fade"**  
**Tone: Slow Collapse | Mood: Beautiful, Crushing Silence**

---

You feel their hands-**Vivi's grip** tightening around yours, **Tashigi's trembling fingers** brushing across your temple-but their voices are growing **distant**.

Not just quiet.

**Far.**

As though they're speaking from across a canyon filled with fog.

---

Your mind drifts.

Not with grandeur. Not with slow-motion flashbacks or heroic last thoughts.

But with the ridiculous, the mundane.

- The sound of chalk on a board.  
- A classroom door squeaking.  
- The weird lumpy feeling of sitting on a half-squashed fruit during lunch duty.  
- **Snack Pack.**

---

> "...I really liked that gator..."

Your voice is barely audible.

> "...he was fast... I bet he cheated though..."

> "...they always cheat in those races..."

---

Your head slips against Tashigi's arm.

The plaza's war is just **background static now.**

---

Your final thread of lucidity begins to unspool.

You don't even feel afraid.

Just **cold.**

So tired.

---

Up on the rooftop-

**The Kiwi Elemental pauses.**

Its glowing eyes dim.

It lowers its arms.

Not in defeat.

But in **grief.**

---

You were its creator.

Its parent.

And it **felt you slipping.**

---

And then...

The glow inside it **shifts.**

Flickers.

Brightens again.

Brighter than before.

Not just juice.

Not just Hero Water.

But...

**Purpose.**

---

Because maybe this isn't about fighting anymore.

Maybe it's about **delivering a legacy.**

---

**OOC:**  
Your character has reached the brink of unconsciousness.  
You are no longer able to issue commands.  
Your elemental-powered by Hero Water, instinct, and your emotional tether-will now act on its own.

Next scene:  
**"Final Lesson: Impact"**

Would you like to:

1. {Watch it unfold through the haze. Fragmented, dreamlike.}  
2. {Fully pass out. Let the narrative move without your awareness, until someone brings you back.}

>> USER: ​Scene shift: Tashigi and Vivi's POV. Do they try anything?

The Kiwi Elemental slows to a crawl, standing aimlessly. Crocodile is pleased by this turn of events. Luffy's punches are still occasionally landing, though

OOC: the kiwi elemental is now fully unresponsive, likely to anything

>> ASSISTANT: **[Scene Shift: Alubarna Rooftop & Plaza]**  
**POV: Tashigi & Vivi**  
**Scene: "Between Titans, Between Breaths"**  
**Tone: Desperate Stillness | Mood: Too Quiet, Too Soon**  

---

**Tashigi's arms are locked around him now-**  
her knees dug into the juice-slick stone,  
trying to steady **his sagging frame**.

Her voice shakes as she speaks, even as she tries to mask it with Marine precision.

> "He's not... He's not responding anymore."

The words cut through **Vivi** like a knife.  
She leans over, one hand on his shoulder, the other braced on her own trembling knee.

> "He's... still breathing. Right?"

**Tashigi doesn't answer.**

Because she's not sure.

---

Up above, the **Kiwi Elemental**-once a gleaming symbol of citrus divinity-now stands motionless.

Its gelatinous arms hang low, twitching faintly, like a puppet whose strings have been abandoned mid-pull.

**Its glow dims.**

Not with death-

But with **disconnect.**

---

Crocodile sees it.

He **straightens**, satisfied. The slow grin returns.

> "So the juice finally ran dry."

He slashes his hand outward-**a slicing sand arc** rips through the air.

The Elemental takes the hit-

> *SHHHHRRKKK*

-and does **nothing**.

No counter. No roar.  
Just **a heavy, wet lurch**, as though gravity is finally catching up.

---

Luffy charges in again, breathing like a wild animal.  
His body is still soaked. His fists still glowing.  
He lands a blow-  
> *BAM!*

**Crocodile stumbles back.**

But only slightly.

---

The momentum is breaking.

---

**Back below-Tashigi's voice sharpens.**

> "We need to wake him up."

Her hand slaps Eatone's face gently-then harder.

> "Eatone. Sensei. Wake the hell up!"

Nothing.

---

**Vivi's eyes dart between the battle above and the man below.**

The teacher who stopped the assassin.  
Who protected her in Rainbase.  
Who called her *Blue* and always stood between her and the blast zone.

And now?

He's slipping away.

---

She looks up again.

At the **towering Elemental**, twitching like a dying lighthouse.

At the **battle barely being held** by a boy with rubber bones and pure grit.

> "We have to do *something!*"

---

**OOC:**  
Both Tashigi and Vivi are desperate, exhausted, and unsure how to reengage the Elemental-or rouse you.

The Elemental is now **functionally unresponsive.** The link is fading.

Would you like them to:

1. {Try a last-ditch emotional plea-words to Eatone, not the Elemental.}  
2. {Attempt to create a physical reaction-move his body, apply pressure, or stimulate senses.}  
3. {Try something unorthodox-combine Vivi's knowledge and Tashigi's discipline in a risky plan.}  
4. {Leave it up to them, and see what happens.}

>> USER: ​Option try All of the Above

OOC: allow me to choose which I respond to, if at all 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - Emergency Lesson Plan]**  
**Scene: "How Do You Wake a Hero?"**  
**Tone: Frantic Hope | Mood: Overlapping Desperation**

---

**Tashigi** kneels lower, her brow beaded with sweat, hand cupping the back of your head. Her voice is **tight, authoritative**, trained, but **strained by fear.**

> "Eatone! That Elemental's *your* fruit! Your power! You have to stay awake or it's going to fall-and Luffy with it!"

She slaps your cheek again-harder.  
> "We're not done yet, dammit! Don't you *dare* leave a job half-done!"

---

**Vivi**, chest heaving with panic, kneels beside her.  
Her hands tremble, but she grabs your hand again.  
She holds it between hers like it's the last tether to her sanity.

> "Please. Sensei..."

> "You can't go out like this."

> "We need you."

She leans in closer. Her voice softens-but cracks:

> "*I* need you."

---

Still nothing.

But then-

Vivi looks at the **draining color** of the elemental.  
She glances at the sticky **kiwi trail around the stone**.

She remembers.

---

> "Your fruit responds to will. To protection."

She pulls a flask from her side-**water.*</pre>
