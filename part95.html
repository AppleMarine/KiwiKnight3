<pre>pping you.**

You glance up.

And find her looking at you with eyes just a little too wet for the weather.

> "You helped save a kingdom, and you're worried about your *visa*?"

---

**Tashigi scoffs-but it's not mean.**

She crosses her arms again, but her posture softens.

> "We're not concerned about *us*, Sensei."

---

Vivi takes a small breath, then speaks, carefully:

> "We're concerned about you."

---

That's when it hits.

The unspoken thing they've been circling.

Not pity.

Not obligation.

Just...

**Worry.**

---

**Tashigi steps forward.**

> "You've been carrying everything since Rain Dinners. Sacrifice after sacrifice, no time to stop and ask what *you* need."

> "And now that it's quiet, you're filling that silence with red tape and humility like a shield."

She doesn't say it cruelly.

She says it like a **comrade.**

Someone who's been there.

---

**Vivi adds softly:**

> "You're allowed to *want* something."

> "Even if it's just... someone to help carry the weight."

---

You pause.

Because you're not used to being the one *receiving* this kind of concern.

---

A breath.

A breeze.

The scent of the sand and the citrus that now belongs to this city, to this chapter.

---

And for a second...

You're not *Teacher Cheng, reluctant protector.*

You're just a man being asked:

**What if you didn't carry everything alone anymore?**

---

**OOC:**
You've hit the emotional core. The moment is yours.

Would you like to:

1. {Finally speak your truth-what you *really* want.}
2. {Deflect one last time-with wit, charm, or weariness.}
3. {Turn the question around: ask *them* what they want from you.}

>> USER: Option 3 - Scoff. Tashigi, you're a badass marine risking your life fighting criminals everyday. Vivi, you're a princess that joined the Mafia at 14 to save an entire country. If there's anyone that deserves 'wants' it's you two, not me.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Gardens - Deflection With a Splash of Reverence]**  
**Scene: "The Ones Who Deserve More"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Sincere | Mood: Admirational, Yet Deeply Deflective**

---

You scoff softly.

Not harshly.  
Not with scorn.

Just... the tired sound of a man who's *very* good at shifting praise like a hot potato.

You roll your eyes with a half-smile, shake your head, and gesture loosely between them.

> "Tashigi."

> "You're a badass Marine, risking your life fighting criminals *every single day.*"

You jab a thumb in **Vivi's** direction, voice still gentle, but filled with respect.

> "And *you*-you're a **princess** who joined the Mafia at **fourteen** to save her entire country."

You let out a little breath.

A dry laugh. Tired. Honest.

> "If there's anyone that deserves ‘wants'... it's you two."

> "*Not me.*"

---

Silence follows.

But not an empty silence.

The kind where **two women look at a man who's clearly never been told he deserves anything just for surviving.**

And now that they know that?

They don't like it.

---

**Vivi's smile fades-not in disappointment.**  
But because you just said something that makes her chest ache a little.

She steps a touch closer.

> "And yet..."

> "You threw yourself in front of a cannonball for me."

---

**Tashigi** moves just enough to flank your other side, arms uncrossed now.

Her voice is cool, but there's fire beneath it.

> "You fought a Warlord with fruit juice and cracked ribs."

> "Don't *ever* tell me that isn't worth something."

---

They're not letting you off the hook this time.

Not cruelly.

Not forcefully.

But with **careful insistence.**

---

> "If we deserve wants," Vivi says quietly, "then so do you."

---

**OOC:**
They've flipped the script again. No longer questioning *what you want*, but asking:

**Why do you think you don't deserve to?**

Would you like to:

1. {Open up-why you keep minimizing yourself.}
2. {Try to laugh it off-one last dodge.}
3. {Finally admit what you *might* want. Even if it scares you.}

>> USER: Option 2 - I mean, maybe I can claim some of Crocodile's bounty, now that his warlord status is revoked. You think those big bounties are like the Cipher Pol most wanted list, where they advertise a bazillion beris, but have small text saying 'up to' and only pay you enough for a ham sandwich?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Gardens - The Citrus-Flavored Deflection]**  
**Scene: "When Jokes Hide Bruises"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Light | Mood: Protective Humor, Understated Vulnerability**

---

You raise a hand, your signature half-smile already working its way onto your face, eyes squinting slightly as if to ward off the sincerity creeping too close.

> "I mean..."

> "Maybe I can claim some of Crocodile's bounty now that his Warlord status is revoked."

You nod as if genuinely considering it, then add with exaggerated skepticism:

> "Although, you think those big-name bounties are like the Cipher Pol ‘Most Wanted' posters?"

You glance between them with mock suspicion.

> "‘Up to' ten bajillion beris, but in the fine print it says *‘actual payout may vary depending on location, time of capture, and number of limbs intact.'*"

A beat.

> "They probably just hand you a ham sandwich and a polite thank-you."

---

**Vivi's mouth opens-then closes.**

Her expression caught somewhere between exasperated amusement and-

**Something more delicate.**

---

**Tashigi**, on the other hand, gives you that look.

You know the one.

The *"I want to shove you over and hug you at the same time"* kind of look.

---

> "You're unbelievable."

She mutters it, not unkindly.

> "You deflect with bureaucracy. *Bureaucracy.*"

---

Vivi lets out a breath and shakes her head slowly.

> "You can't even imagine what it would be like to just... *ask* for something, can you?"

---

They don't sound angry.

They sound...

**Sad.**

Not for themselves.

For **you.**

---

Because no matter how witty the comment...  
No matter how crisp the sarcasm...

**They heard it.**

That quiet truth beneath your words:

*"I don't think I deserve to ask for more."*

---

And now?

They're not going to let that go.

---

**Tashigi steps in front of you now, her eyes steady.**

> "Then how about this?"

> "What if we say it's *our* turn to ask for something?"

---

**OOC: They're not waiting anymore.**

Would you like to:

1. {Ask what they want. Let them say it.}  
2. {Keep joking-but show a flicker of truth.}  
3. {Say nothing. Just listen. Let the moment fall where it may.}

>> USER: Option 3 - I mean, I got free healthcare and lodging from the palace. That's pretty good for lil ol me

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Gardens - The Man Who Wouldn't Ask]**  
**Scene: "Pretty Good for Lil Ol' Me"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Quiet Humor | Mood: Understated, Exposing, Deeply Human**

---

You shrug, that same old half-smile stretching across your face like armor that's been worn a few too many times but still somehow holds.

> "I mean..."

You look around-the grand towers, the clean breeze, the taste of citrus still in the air from what might've been your most absurd battle to date.

> "I got free healthcare."

A motion to the palace behind you.

> "And lodging from a royal family."

You roll your shoulder, as if trying to wave the thought off like a lazy summer fly.

> "That's... pretty good for lil ol' me."

---

You mean it as a joke.

Almost.

But neither of them laugh this time.

---

**Tashigi's brow furrows just slightly**, her arms dropping to her sides.

**Vivi**, lips parted, looks at you with an expression that isn't surprise anymore-it's **confirmation**.

The kind that comes from finally understanding someone who's spent the entire journey downplaying everything they are.

---

Not because you're modest.

Not because you're clever.

But because **you've never once thought you could ask for more**.

---

And now they both know that.

---

**Vivi** steps closer. Her voice is soft-but her words are firm.

> "You deserve more than ‘pretty good.'"

---

**Tashigi**, next to her, nods.

She says it sim</pre>
