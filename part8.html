<pre>rrassed **for you**.

> "No, no, sir. Sorry. We've just got a lot of first-time guests getting lost in the maze of lounges. I'm part of guest relations security.  
Just making sure no one's straying into the VIP zones without an escort. For safety. That's all."

His tone's just barely professional, but *he's buying it*. You've thrown him off his rhythm.

He pulls out a **small, crystal-paned tablet** from his belt and taps into it.

> "Uh, let me confirm your room, actually. What's the last name on your reservation? Shouldn't take more than a minute."

He's already halfway convinced it's a software error or an overzealous scan. You're a **non-threat** in his eyes now.

**📝 Info Gained / Advantages:**

- Tail has completely dropped his guard - you're not flagged as a threat anymore.  
- He's part of **Rain Dinners internal surveillance**, not a high-level Baroque agent.
- He's carrying a **guest registry device**, likely linked to all room keys and casino access points.
- You now have an opening to **feed him false info**, stall, or potentially dig for more-without being suspected.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Feed him your real name and reservation info-play it 100% straight. Gather intel on what they log, and if you're already flagged.}
2. {Give a **slightly wrong** name and see if he corrects you-test how close they're monitoring you.}
3. {Fake an "Oh! Sorry, I actually left my wallet in the room!" and use this moment to vanish toward the VIP hall or a side exit.}
4. {Ask him some "innocent" tourist questions: "So what's *really* in the VIP area? I saw a weird animal in the aquarium..." See how much he'll share.}
5. {Lean in and say, "Off the record... do you think Rain Dinners is safe right now?" Stir the pot. See if he'll spill under pressure.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 1 - Err, Cheng. Room number... I think it was one of the balcony suites, room 703. Complimentary bathrobe service should be included.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected - "Err, Cheng. Room 703. Bathrobe service."**  
**🎭 Bluff Level: Light Deception, Heavy Specificity (Too boring to question)**
**🎲 Social Check - (Eatone +2 Rapport, +1 Believable Details) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**🎲 Opposed Roll - Security Agent Database Cross-check (Generic Protocol +1, Distracted by Complacency -2) = Result: -1 [Terrible]**  
**🎯 CRITICAL SUCCESS - You are now officially ‘Cheng of 703' in the resort's eyes.**

---

> "Err... Cheng. Room number... 703. Balcony suite. I think it came with bathrobe service?"

You scratch the back of your head in that very specific, **"I'm a clueless but polite guest"** way as the agent taps away on his tablet, clearly expecting to find a red flag-or at least a missing name.

But then:

> **"Ah-yep. Found it. Cheng. Room 703, East Balcony Level, bathrobe service included, welcome snack delivered an hour ago. You're good."**

He nods as if trying to convince himself he *wasn't* just following a normal guy who smells vaguely like kiwis and carries a schoolteacher's posture. He doesn't even question how you didn't remember your own name right away-your tone was just that convincing.

> "Apologies again. We've had a few counterfeit passes lately-couple guests slipped into the VIP levels earlier, caused a fuss. Whole floor's restricted now."  
> "You're clear. Have a great night, Mr. Cheng."

And just like that, the tail backs off.

You're now officially registered in the system under **‘Cheng, Room 703'**, which not only gives you **plausible deniability** for any further movement, but also gives you a clean name to use should you need to bypass basic check-in points or surveillance.

He strolls off toward the roulette tables, muttering into an earpiece-*not about you.*

**📝 Status Update:**

- ✅ You now have a **clean alias** in Rain Dinners systems: *Cheng, Room 703*.
- 🛏️ Room 703 is now a safe fallback location.
- 🧃 Your cover as a clueless tourist is rock solid-for now.
- 🚨 You're not on the internal watchlist-yet.
- 📱 Security agent's tablet confirms your name, suite, and amenities. You *might* be able to spoof others now, if you get access.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Actually head up to Room 703. Check out what the "Cheng" package includes. Could be useful, or hiding a bugged minibar.}
2. {Use your new alias to request a "forgotten guest pass" to the VIP level. Play the curious guest angle.}
3. {Mosey toward the aquarium again. Now you know you're not being watched, it might be time to see if Smoker is real or a ghost.}
4. {Leave the casino floor and head toward the docks. You've made your mark here-maybe Yazir the kebab seller knows something Cheng doesn't.}
5. {Circle back to the old woman muttering over napkins. You've got time, and she might be more than she looks.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 3 - Was there really a Marine Captain in a casino of all places? Also ask a passing server for a Daiquiri.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 3 Selected - "Was that *really* Smoker? What would a Marine Captain be doing here?"**  
**🍸 Side Action: Requesting a Daiquiri - Smooth Tourist Disguise Maintained**  
**🎲 Observation Roll - Eatone (Careful + Kiwi Sensory + Lore) = 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Daiquiri Service Roll - NPC Bartender (Efficiency + Flair) = 5 [Great]**  
**✅ Outcome: You gather intel *and* get a perfect drink. That's a win.**

---

You casually peel off from the gaming floor, sipping at your surroundings rather than any drink-until a **passing server in a crimson vest** walks by carrying a tray of martinis, banana coladas, and something that looks vaguely radioactive.

You raise a hand and smile.

> "Excuse me. Could I get a Daiquiri? Classic, please. None of the glow-in-the-dark stuff."

She nods with a professional smile.

> "Of course, sir. One daiquiri-no tourist gimmicks."

She disappears toward the bar.

Now, with your cover secured and a drink en route, you drift back toward the **aquarium**-but you don't head straight for the glass. Instead, you take the long route, weaving around through a high-traffic area and stopping near a tall fountain spouting **blue-lit water** from a golden crocodile's mouth. It gives you a **clean line of sight** to the aquarium... and its dim interior.

You stare into the tank.

The room is darker here. Quieter. Even the background jazz softens into near silence as you approach the blue glow of the glass.

**Something is moving again**-but slower this time. Not the creature. A figure.

You narrow your eyes.

There's a **man inside the aquarium chamber**, just behind the outer glass wall, in a **tight security passage** not visible from most angles. For a moment, his **white jacket flutters**, revealing the unmistakable **Marine crest** and the nameplate that makes your stomach twist:

> **SMOKER**

He stands alone in the hall, arms crossed, **leaning back against the glass** with his usual scowl carved into his face like a rock formation. A pair of **Den Den Mushi-like devices** blink faintly near his feet-recorders?

He's watching something on a **hidden monitor** just inside the tank room-likely observing the **inner VIP prison complex**, if the rumors are true.

> He's not here as a guest. He's infiltrated. Alone.

You don't have a clear way to reach him-security panels block the lower hallway entrance to wherever he's slipped into-but now you **know**.

> **Captain Smoker is on-site. Incognito. Watching Rain Dinners from the inside.**

Then-

> "Your drink, sir."

You turn to find the server from earlier smiling politely. She presents you with an elegant glass-a flawless **classic daiquiri**, just as requested. No banana. No toxins. Smells like fresh lime, rum, and mint.

> "On the house. Someone noticed your ‘great taste.'" she says with a wink, and walks away without waiting for a tip.

You now have **the best drink in the building** and a mental map forming of who's in play.
