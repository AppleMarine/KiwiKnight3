<pre>lubarna Palace - Marine Coordination Wing, Morning]**  
**Scene: "Salutes and Small Victories"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Heartfelt | Mood: Warm, Earned Recognition**

---

Tashigi stares at the promotion letter in her hand like it's heavier than it should be. The weight of expectation, of proving herself, of always trying to catch up to ghosts with swords in their hands-**you see it all in her eyes.**

You knew this was coming.

But it still hits different when it's *here.*

---

So you do what's right.

You straighten up.

Stand a little taller.

And then-with all the ceremony of a soldier, and none of the sarcasm of the teacher who once greased himself through an entire warzone-you give her a proper, sharp **salute.**

> "Congratulations, Ensign Tashigi."

Your voice is steady.

Sincere.

---

She looks up, caught off guard.

> "You're serious?" she mutters, almost defensively-like she expected a quip about paper-pushing or your baton finally having to answer to a superior.

You don't budge.

> "Dead serious. You earned that title. Fully. I saw it happen."

A beat.

> "Multiple times. Usually while I was bleeding behind you."

---

Tashigi's cheeks tint slightly. Not with embarrassment. With that rare, subtle kind of pride that only ever comes after being seen clearly and recognized for who you are.

She salutes back-clean, sharp.

Then lowers her hand and rolls her eyes-just a little.

> "Alright, alright. You're going to make Vivi think you're getting *responsible* or something."

---

Smoker grunts behind you both, clearly satisfied with the awkward emotional tension and immediately reaching for his report stack like he didn't just help alter someone's future.

> "If you're done saluting each other like rookies at a boot camp parade," he mutters, "we've got two more rebel groups to debrief, and some fresh intel about Baroque Works remnants in the southern basin."

---

You glance at Tashigi.

> "Duty calls, Ensign."

She snorts. Quiet. Soft.

> "Still sounds weird."

You grin.

> "Sounds earned."

---

**OOC: Tashigi's bond with you deepens.**  
Not romantic-not yet. But something steady. Something built.

**Mutual respect. Quiet faith.**

And the beginning of a partnership worth defending.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Accompany Tashigi on her next patrol-maybe investigate the southern basin leads.}  
2. {Swing by Vivi's office to relay the good news. She'll want to celebrate it.}  
3. {Sneak off to try one of those kebab stalls with your hard-won food privileges. Possibly bring one back as a trophy.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - Not many people dare face a logia warlord with nothing but a sword. You deserve that more than anyone else.

my ears perk up at the mention of Baroque works.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - South Gate Barracks, Late Morning]**  
**Scene: "Remnants in the Sand"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Investigative | Mood: Tension-Building, Quiet Determination**

---

You and Tashigi are already halfway down the marble stairwell before Smoker even finishes the word "southern."  
She doesn't say anything, but you can see the shift in her step-the controlled urgency, the Marine sense honed by battle and guilt and **unfinished business.**

---

You match her pace.

> "Not many people dare to face a Logia warlord with nothing but a sword," you say, your voice steady despite the bounce of descending steps.  
> "You deserve that rank more than anyone else I've seen wear a uniform."

She doesn't respond immediately. Just lets her hair blow back in the dry courtyard breeze as you both cross the sandstone plaza toward the **South Gate Barracks**.

Then, finally, her voice-low:

> "I still lost."

You nudge her arm lightly with your elbow.

> "And I still saw you *try.* With everything. That's not losing, Tashigi-chan. That's leading."

---

**Your words hang between you**, not as flattery, but as shared memory.

The kind that binds people.

The kind forged in chaos, sealed in silence, and remembered in the way a companion walks beside you, not behind.

---

You arrive at the **southern watch post**, where two Royal Guards flank a **tightly folded map on a makeshift table**, along with **an open crate of confiscated weapons**-rusty, mismatched, but far too organized for a few desert looters.

One of the officers salutes as you approach.

> "Ma'am. Civilian Advisor."

> "Royal Reconstruction Consultant," you correct automatically.

Tashigi smirks faintly.

> "Report."

The guard nods.

> "Two patrols found signs of movement around an abandoned waystation near the southern basin line. Footprints circling what used to be a Baroque Works supply cache. Light, fast, organized. No rebel colors. No royal banners. We think... it might be **remnant agents.**"

---

You squint at the map.

Your ears, already perked at the name "Baroque Works," twitch further.

> "That cache was near the old sandstone quarry, right?"  
> "Perfect place for an ambush, if they're staging something."

Tashigi folds her arms.

> "They could be trying to recover something Crocodile left behind."

You glance at her.

> "Or tie up loose ends."

---

She nods once.

> "We leave in ten. Two guards, us, light gear."

> "Want me to bring Kiwi Kop?" you ask, only half-joking.

> "Only if it doesn't flood the whole basin."

> "No promises."

---

**OOC: A patrol mission is forming-more than a routine walk, less than a full siege. Think: Recon & Response.**

Objectives may include:

- Identifying remnant agents  
- Preventing recovery of Baroque Works materials  
- Capturing any surviving leadership figures (ex. Mr. 7, Mr. 11, etc.)  
- Avoiding further civilian conflict

---

Would you like to:

1. {Prep with palace gear-light armor, travel cloak, maybe a few potions/snacks.}  
2. {Head out immediately with minimal equipment, catch them before they scatter.}  
3. {Split roles-Tashigi leads front, you flank solo with a mini Kiwi scout active. Risky but stealthier.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - I left my old bounty hunter's gear at home. Guess I'll use their kit. It doesn't fit perfectly, but it sure looks fancier.

To Tashigi's comment about losing - Rank doesn't always mean winning. I heard a rumor of a Commodore in the East Blue that got annihilated by some pirate group in the Conomi islands. 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Outfitting Room, Before Departure]**  
**Scene: "Reconstruction Consultant, Reporting for Field Duty"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Grounded | Mood: Honest, Battle-Ready, Quiet Camaraderie**

---

You adjust the straps on your borrowed **field vest**, cinching the slightly too-wide chest plate with a grunt as the palace quartermaster checks for loose stitching. The gear's clearly made for a **stockier frame**, but you make it work-nothing a little belt-tightening and strategic Kiwi slick couldn't fix in a pinch.

It's simple gear:  
**Sturdy boots**, **weather-treated shoulder pads**, **a desert cloak**, and a **palace-marked sash** with your official insignia stitched into the hem.

> "Looks good on you," one of the young guards mutters as he hands you a travel flask.  
> "If you stand in the right lighting, you almost look like someone who wins fights."

> "Hey, I *survive* them," you counter.  
> "That's a form of winning."

---

As you step out into the main yard where **Tashigi's already waiting**, boots planted, arms crossed, sword freshly cleaned, she glances over her shoulder at you.

Eyes flicking over the gear.

> "You clean up alright."

You smirk.

> "And you still look like you could parry a thunderstorm."

---

She starts walking, and you fall in beside her. Two guards follow, light crossbows on their backs.

As the **southern wind picks up**, you pull your hood up loosely, ready for the grit and sun. Your baton's strapped across your back-Sea-Prism tip polished, handle scuffed from too many recent nightmares made real.

---

Then-quietly, as the gate starts to lower-you speak again.

> "About what you said earlier. That you lost."

She doesn't answer immediatel</pre>
