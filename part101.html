>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - The Royal Dining Hall]**  
**Scene: "A Seat at the Table"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Awkward Dignity | Mood: Warm, Formal, Lightly Teasing with a Dash of Tension**

---

You glance at Vivi's outstretched arm.

You glance at Tashigi, who *immediately raises one eyebrow.*

You glance back at the arm.

You clear your throat with the seriousness of a man asked to dance in a minefield.

Then, awkwardly-*stiffly*-you slide your arm into hers.

> "...Don't expect me to curtsy."

---

**Vivi laughs**, eyes bright.

> "I'd pay money to see you try."

---

Tashigi mutters behind her tea mug:

> "That's going in the permanent record."

---

The three of you stroll down the long marble corridor, the sun now fully risen and casting honeyed light through the palace windows. Staff bow as you pass, some still murmuring quietly about "the juice knight" with awe, confusion, and *very mixed interpretations.*

---

You reach the **double doors** of the **royal dining hall**, which part with gentle fanfare and the soft sound of a harp playing from a corner musician.

You step in-looking your best, walking with *some semblance of dignity*-

And immediately **lock eyes with a man seated at the head of the table.**

---

**King Nefertari Cobra.**

---

He's not dressed in ceremonial robes today.

Just a light royal tunic, trimmed in gold, hands folded in front of him, expression neutral-but amused.

Very amused.

His gaze flicks from **your arm linked with Vivi's**, to **Tashigi's mug of tea and her death grip on your other side**, to **your suddenly straightened posture**-

And he chuckles.

> "Ah."

> "So *this* is the teacher."

---

**You freeze.**

Vivi's arm is still tucked neatly in yours.

Tashigi sips her tea like she might drown herself in it.

---

> "You've been quite the topic of conversation," Cobra continues, gesturing toward the table.

> "Please. Sit. We have honeycakes this morning."

A pause.

> "And I'd *very much* like to hear your story."

---

Vivi gently pats your arm.

> "You'll be fine."

**Tashigi mutters under her breath:**

> "I told you the king had a sense of humor."

---

And with that, the King of Alabasta gestures again-inviting you to join **his table**, **his daughter**, and a seat **very, very close to power.**

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Sit and regale the king with your tale-humble or dramatic.}
2. {Try to deflect politely and let Tashigi or Vivi summarize.}
3. {Ask him a question instead-why *he* looks amused.}

>> USER: Option 1 - I turn to Vivi, then back to King Robin. I quickly pull out of Vivi's arm and bow deeply.

Y-your majesty, did you not already hear the story from blue- I mean viv- I mean her highness?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Dining Hall of Doom (and Honeycakes)]**  
**Scene: "The Oral Report You Weren't Ready For"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Comically Formal | Mood: Flustered, Endearing, Disarming**

---

You blink once.

Twice.

Then the full gravity of *oh-my-god-I-linked-arms-with-a-princess-in-front-of-her-dad* hits you square in the sternum like an unlicensed Sea Train.

---

You immediately disengage from Vivi like she's a live wire and pivot into a textbook **school presentation bow**-spine straight, head down, arms practically doing jazz hands of panic at your sides.

---

> "Y-Your Majesty!" you blurt, nearly smacking your forehead into the edge of the table.

> "Did you not already hear the story from Blue-I mean Viv-I mean Her High-uh..."

You stare at the floor.

> "...Your Royal Vivi-ness."

---

**Vivi nearly chokes on her laughter.**

Tashigi sighs in long-suffering sympathy and sips more tea like it's fermented escape.

---

**Cobra**, to his immense credit, does not burst into laughter.

But the amusement in his eyes gleams so brightly, it might as well be fireworks.

He folds his hands.

> "I heard *parts* of the story."

> "From the Marines, from my daughter, from intercepted reports from the Baroque remnants..."

He leans forward slightly.

> "But I'd rather hear the *version told by the man who created a sentient juice elemental, rode into battle like a tidal wave, and then apparently passed out in my daughter's lap."

A beat.

> "Twice."

---

The silence hangs in the air like someone suspended a fruit basket mid-air.

---

**You may respond with:**

1. {Panic. Just a little. Maybe joke about a third time.}
2. {Straighten and launch into a full, humble recap of your role.}
3. {Deflect with bureaucratic accuracy: "Would you prefer a written statement, sire?"}

>> USER: For the record, the lap thing was not on purpose, and fully out of my control.

After regaining my bearings and taking a seat (disturbingly flanked on either side by Vivi and Tashigi), I take a deep breath, a sip of tea to settle the butterflies in my stomach, and begin telling my story.

A story about a man going on a vacation to a perfectly legitimate resort. About finding a group of suspicious folks sneaking through the side streets. About checking into a hotel that felt greasier than a cheap plate of kebabs. About Snack Pack the bananagator. About a mysterious blue-haired girl that I almost snitched to casino security. About a plucky young marine petty officer that I ran into in the halls, who almost stabbed me. About rescuing that same marine from an assassin in a dark corridor. About finding a warlord monologuing to a princess trapped in a cage with pirates. About a suicide mission buying time for their escape. About escaping through the front door and going for a camel ride. About almost fleeing the country the moment we made it out of Rainbase. About taking two cannonballs more than what a doctor would recommend to protect a lady. About raising a golem of juice to protect those close to me. About lying in a cobblestone-floored alleyway to catch my breath. About watching a rubber-boy, smoke-man, and a certain marine with a sword throw everything they could to stop a warlord. About a princess who stopped a war. About a greased seal/human torpedo who concussed himself on a breastplate. About almost drinking the Hero Water and dying. About accidentally creating an emerald engine of destruction that could stop a warlord.

And about how two young women fought a crocodile to restore hope to a beautiful nation.

**Scene: "The Truth of a Teacher"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Storyteller's Poise | Mood: Humble, Poignant, Surreal, Heroic in Spite of Itself**

---

You raise a hand, just briefly, as you take the steaming cup of tea offered by one of the palace staff. Its floral notes are subtle, gentle-far more refined than the instant packet stuff back home.

You sip. Swallow. Exhale.

Set the cup down.

The weight of **two pairs of eyes** settles on you from either side-**Vivi**, to your left, light glinting in her gaze, lips pressed together with that unreadable mix of *affection* and *don't-say-anything-stupid*.  
**Tashigi**, on your right, has her arms crossed-but her tea remains untouched. She's waiting. Sharp-eyed. Curious. A little protective.

And across the table sits **King Cobra**, composed, polite, his elbows resting lightly beside a still-warm plate of honeycakes he hasn't yet touched.

---

So you begin.

Not with drama.

Not with pomp.

Just **your voice**-a little dry, a little sardonic, but growing steadier with each word.

---

> "It all started with a vacation."

---

They weren't expecting that.

---

> "Summer break at the school I teach at. I saw a brochure. Bright lights. *â€˜Rain Dinners: Rated the #1 Resort in Alabasta.'*"  
> "The prices were suspiciously low, but I figured maybe there was a local festival. Political unrest discount, or something."

You shrug.

> "Anyway. I get on a ferry. Packed mostly with tourists. Some strange types on board-hooded, twitchy. Thought they might've been weird locals or </pre>
