**Would you like to:**

1. {Head down for breakfast. You may run into Vivi, Cobra, or Smoker.}  
2. {Stretch and prep for your sparring match. Tashigi's probably already there.}  
3. {Detour to check any mail or messages left for you overnight.}

>> USER: ​Option 3 - head to the mail room in the palace. I wonder if they folks back home processed my resignation yet. Or heard the rumors in the tabloids about my alleged heroics (that teacher from our local school did what?!)

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Mail Room, Morning]**  
**Scene: "Letters, Leaves, and the Legend of That One Teacher"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Curious, Slightly Dreadful | Mood: Light-Hearted, Homebound Nostalgia**

---

The palace mail room is surprisingly modest for a royal estate-just a long counter, several cubbies sorted by department and status, and a sleepy postmaster flipping through dispatches while sipping cactus coffee thick enough to coat a spoon in rebellion.

---

You step up, clearing your throat.

The postmaster peers at you over the rim of his mug.

> "You the fruit-slinger from guest room 2B?"

You sigh.

> "That's me."

He grunts and hands you a surprisingly **thick bundle** of letters and scrolls tied up with twine and juice-proof wax.

---

You step off to the side and start going through them, sorting into two piles: **"Important"** and **"Cringe."**

---

### LETTER 1: From Your School Administration  
**Red envelope. Official wax seal. Principal Okada's handwriting.**

> "Dear Mr. Cheng,  
> We received your resignation letter. We would like to inform you that:  
> - You are still considered *on extended leave* pending review.  
> - Your absence during school break is not considered misconduct, assuming you're still alive.  
> - Please confirm you are, in fact, still alive.  
> - If you have not been eaten by pirates, please respond with proof of survival and intent.  
> - Your chalk drawer has been repurposed."  

**PS: "One of the students saw your face in the World Economy News. Please advise if this is a hoax."**

---

### LETTER 2: From One of Your Students  
**Lined paper. Crayon drawings. Signed "Masato."**

> "Sensei!! Are you a pirate now??  
> Did you beat up Crocodile?? My big brother said you used fruit to make a dinosaur made of goo!!!  
> Is that true??  
> Also, did you ride a duck?? Can I see a duck??  
> Please write back. School is boring with Mr. Ichikawa. He smells like eggs.  
> - Masato"  

(Drawing included: You holding a sword bigger than Tashigi's, riding a dragon labeled "Snackpak.")

---

### LETTER 3: From the Tabloid Clipping Service  
**Stamped: ‘EXPEDITED - HERO RECOGNITION DIVISION'**

An enclosed clipping from the World Economy News:  
> **"Teacher or Terror? The Kiwi Knight of Alabasta!"**  
> "Eyewitnesses claim the previously unknown Eatone Cheng-listed as a *part-time bounty hunter* and *full-time substitute teacher*-engaged Warlord Crocodile using mysterious fruit-based summons!"  
> "Government officials have not confirmed whether this man will be recruited by the Marines or charged with the destruction of luxury property across Rainbase."  

(Two photos: One of you collapsed in Vivi's lap; another, a poorly rendered artist depiction of you riding your own juice elemental like a rodeo champion.)

---

You exhale.

You run your hand through your hair.

You consider going back to bed.

---

But in truth... it's a little heartening.

They haven't forgotten you.  
They're waiting.  
And Masato wants to meet a duck.

---

**OOC: You now have three actionable items:**

1. **Reply to the school.** Confirm your safety and future intentions.  
2. **Write back to your student.** Maybe include a sketch or story.  
3. **Send a rebuttal to the tabloids.** Or lean into it. Maybe start charging autograph fees?

---

Would you like to:

1. {Quickly respond to one or more letters before your sparring match.}  
2. {Tuck them away for later and head toward the training yard.}  
3. {Show the letters to Vivi or Tashigi-maybe the drawing of "Snackpak."}

>> USER: ​Option 1 / 3 - 
To the school: Thank you for the extended leave status. I plan to stay in Alubarna to assist with reconstruction in Alabasta. The WEF article is unfortunately, mostly true.
To the student: It wasn't a dinosaur, but it sure looked felt like one. Your teacher fought a big bad pirate to save a princess. I'll come visit sometime with souvenirs. Place a royal palace postcard and local snacks in the envelope.

 Mail off the two letters.

Head to the guard's barracks, where the sparring field, and Tashigi, awaits. I keep the letters that I read tucked under my arm.

OOC: Vivi may have caught wind of the spar 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Guard Barracks Training Yard, Morning]**  
**Scene: "Steel and Citrus at Sunrise"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Calm to Focused | Mood: Playful Anticipation, Growing Discipline**

---

With your **letters sealed and stamped**, your conscience lighter and your soul slightly stickier from fame, you head down the corridor, passing early morning palace staff and the occasional duck trooper getting lost on the third floor again.

The two letters rest neatly beneath your arm.  
The postcard sticks out with a little cactus stamp and a tiny smiley face you don't remember drawing.

---

As you round the long exterior walkway leading toward the **guard barracks**, the crisp air hits your face-morning sun glinting off the polished clay tiles of the **sparring yard**, where guards train in tight, disciplined formations.

But today?

**A different audience waits.**

---

**Tashigi is already there**, standing beneath the shade of a training arch, **coat draped neatly over a post**, white undershirt tucked into belted trousers, **sword already unsheathed and gleaming**.

She's **stretching. Calm. Focused. Controlled.**

But you know her well enough now to notice the twitch of her jaw as she spots you.

> "Took you long enough."

---

You lift your hands defensively.

> "Had a post office emergency. Hero stuff. Autographs. International mail."

You slide the letters into your coat pocket, give your baton a lazy twirl, and take your spot on the sand-dusted sparring circle.

---

Just beyond the edge of the training wall, **a quiet observer peeks through** a lattice screen.

**Blue hair. Curious gaze.**

Vivi doesn't speak, but she watches.

**Quietly rooting.**

---

Tashigi adjusts her grip.

> "No powers," she says simply. "No summons. Just baton versus blade."

You blink.

> "But my entire fighting style is based around improvisation, cowardice, and mildly sticky distractions."

She raises an eyebrow.

> "That's a no, then?"

---

You grin.  
Extend your baton with a *snap*.

> "Alright, alright. Let's see how much Lady Riko's yellow belt has held up."

---

**OOC: Sparring Match Initiated!**

This is a friendly match, with minimal risk of injury-but your **dexterity, reaction time**, and **creative use of basic baton skills** will all factor into performance.

No Devil Fruit powers.  
No elementals.  
Just **grit**, **timing**, and possibly **screaming like a gym teacher being chased by geese**.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Go aggressive out the gate. Press her hard, see if you can catch her off guard.}  
2. {Start defensive-observe, adapt, and wait for an opening.}  
3. {Talk during the fight. Distract her. Ask personal questions mid-combat, teacher-style.}

>> USER: ​Option 2 - I don't know the full extent of her skills, just that she's good. Maybe not as sharp as the that green haired kid, but she's up there.

OOC: Combat rolls should be catastrophically weighted against me

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Training Yard - Sparring Circle]**  
**Scene: "Clash of Steel and Substitute"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Focused | Mood: Tactical, Doomed (But With Dignity)**

---

You grip your baton-not extended, not flared, just solid-and keep your stan</pre>
