<pre>codile's trap, saved Princess Vivi twice, **and** turned the desert into a salad dressing."

---

**Smoker stares.**

One puff.

Two.

Then:

> "...So bar, then."

---

**Vivi bursts out laughing.**  
It's that kind of breathless, drained, post-near-death-laugh that's more tears than joy.

> "He said he was just here on vacation..."

She wipes her eyes, still smiling.

> "He was supposed to be a schoolteacher. I think he *still is.*"

---

Smoker squints at you again, unconvinced.

> "He's drooling on royalty."

---

> "It's involuntary," Tashigi mutters through gritted teeth.

---

Smoker sighs, shaking his head.

He looks at Tashigi.

Then at Vivi.

Then back to you.

> "Alright. I want a full report."

> "In writing. With charts."

> "And you-"  
He jabs a thumb at your unconscious, vaguely muttering form.  
> "When he wakes up, make sure he understands this whole â€˜saving a kingdom by accident' thing? That's not standard operating procedure."

---

He flicks the ash off his cigar and turns to walk away, his coat billowing behind him.

> "Oh. And if he's got a bounty now, I'm not paying for it."

---

**OOC:**
- Smoker now understands your impact-though refuses to emotionally process it.  
- You are **not in trouble... yet.**  
- Tashigi has **defended your honor** (and very questionable judgment).  
- Vivi is **still laughing.**

Would you like next scene to be:

1. {You waking up, again. Somewhere safe.}  
2. {Straw Hats preparing to leave-Vivi's farewell.}  
3. {Time skip-your return home.}

>> USER: Option X - The Straw hat crew goes to secure Cobra. Luffy heads into the palace to check out the pone-somethings. Wasn't there another baroque agent involved?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Loose Ends & Forbidden Stones]**  
**Scene: "The Final Threads of Baroque Works"**  
**POV: Straw Hat Crew**  
**Tone: Post-Battle | Mood: Suspicion, Curiosity, Unease**

---

The sun is lower now.

The war is over.

But the dust hasn't settled-**not completely.**

---

**The Straw Hats**, dirty, sticky, and half-limping, begin spreading out through the palace ruins.

**Zoro and Sanji** head toward the inner halls, weapons ready, checking for any lingering agents.  
**Nami** mutters under her breath about her shoes being ruined.  
**Usopp** is carrying a partially conscious Chopper like he's a wounded soldier in a dramatic opera.

And **Luffy**-bandaged, grinning, and coated in drying kiwi-looks up at the towering palace with wide, curious eyes.

---

> "So where's that pone... pone-something?"

---

**Vivi**, having ensured the city is safe and her father is being tended to, catches up to the crew near the central doors.

> "Poneglyph."

> "And yes... Crocodile was after it. It's hidden beneath the palace."

---

**Robin.**

She flashes in Vivi's memory like a shadow.

The last **Baroque Works officer** who hadn't fallen.

The one who didn't fight.

The one who **translated ancient texts** with her fingers and her eyes.

---

Vivi turns sharply.

> "There was... one more."

> "Miss All Sunday."

> "She's still out there."

---

Luffy cracks his knuckles, walking up the broken palace steps.

> "Guess I'll go ask the rock."

---

---

**OOC:**

- The Straw Hats are now **searching the palace**, looking to secure **Cobra** and discover **the Poneglyph**.
- **Nico Robin** has not been accounted for-she is the **last major Baroque Works officer unaccounted for**.
- Luffy is about to walk directly into **one of the most important lore events** in the world... while still kinda sticky.

Would you like to:

1. {Scene shift to Luffy entering the chamber with the Poneglyph.}  
2. {Follow the crew as they locate Cobra.}  
3. {Return to Eatone's POV, post-nap.}

>> USER: Option 1 - A summary

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - The Chamber Beneath]**  
**Scene: "The Stone That Holds the Truth"**  
**POV: Narrative Summary**  
**Tone: Lore-Heavy | Mood: Quiet, Ominous, Crucial**

---

As the chaos above settles and the kingdom exhales in pulp-scented peace, **Luffy**, still bleeding, bruised, and utterly unbothered, descends into the secret chamber beneath the palace.

Guided by instinct, residual directions, and the smell of something *weird and old*, he arrives at the **Poneglyph Room**.

---

There, in the darkness-

Stands a **massive stone monolith**, carved with a language lost to time.

A **Poneglyph.**

---

**Nico Robin**-Miss All Sunday-stands before it.

Her back to him.

Hands clasped. Calm.

She does not raise a weapon.

She does not run.

---

When **Luffy enters**, she turns slowly.

No hostility.

Just... curiosity.

---

> "You're not supposed to be down here."

> "But I suppose you'll go wherever you like."

---

Luffy stares at the stone, then back at her.

> "What's it say?"

---

She smiles.

Not like Crocodile.

Not like a villain.

Something more... personal.

---

> "It speaks of Pluton."

> "An ancient weapon capable of erasing islands."

> "Crocodile wanted it to conquer the world."

> "But this stone... doesn't tell him where to find it."

---

Luffy tilts his head.

> "Do *you* know?"

---

Robin looks at him.

A long moment.

Then:

> "No."

---

And that is, perhaps, the first real truth spoken in this room in centuries.

---

As Marines close in.

As Cobra is rescued.

As Alabasta begins to rise from its knees-

Robin looks to Luffy...

And something in her eyes says she's **already chosen her next path**.

---

**OOC Summary:**

- The Poneglyph beneath Alubarna **does not contain the location of Pluton**, only knowledge *about* it.
- Nico Robin, a Baroque agent until now, has **betrayed Crocodile's expectations** by keeping the truth.
- Luffy and Robin share a moment of quiet understanding.
- Her future is about to take a sharp turn.

Would you like to:

1. {Scene shift to Eatone waking up post-battle.}  
2. {Scene shift to Cobra and Vivi reunited.}  
3. {Follow Robin's quiet exit from the ruins.}

>> USER: Option 3

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Ruins - The Quiet Exit of a Survivor]**  
**Scene: "The Woman Who Read Too Much"**  
**POV: Nico Robin**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Shadowed Transition**

---

The cool stone of the **Poneglyph chamber** hums in silence.

The footsteps of **Monkey D. Luffy** fade above her, replaced by the rumble of voices, boots, and celebration returning to the palace.

Victory.

For the kingdom.

For the rebels.

For the children.

Not for her.

---

**Nico Robin** remains in the room just a moment longer, her fingers tracing the ancient carvings.

She's memorized every symbol.

Every line.

Even the ones she pretended not to read aloud for **Crocodile**.

---

> "He never cared what it said."

> "Only what it could get him."

---

She brushes juice pulp from her shoulder absently.

The scent of kiwi lingers in the air like a final mockery of the Warlord's failed legacy.

She smiles faintly.

---

> "I liked the teacher better."

---

She turns.

Ascends the broken stairwell with the grace of a cat, even with stone crumbling beneath her heels.

The guards are too busy.

The Marines aren't watching for **her**-not yet.

---

She passes by the **rubble** of the upper halls.

Past the bodies of **defeated agents**, and the still-smoking crater where **Crocodile** was last seen.

She pauses there.

Just long enough to let the dust cling to her cloak.

Just long enough to whisper:

> "You were powerful, but never wise."

---

And then she slips away.

Through a side passage no one remembered.

Into the shadows.

---

For now.

---

Because this isn't the end for **Nico Robin**.

Only a turning page.

---

**OOC:**
- Nico Robin has **abandoned Baroque Works**.
- She is now a fugitive once more-no master, no orders.
- Her curiosity remains: about history, the Will of D, and perhaps... *that strange, citrus-summoning civilian* she noticed only once from a rooftop.

Would you like to:

1. {Return to Eatone, post-battle.}  
2. {Cut to Cobra and Vivi's reunion.}  
3. {Scene skip: Straw Hats prepare to leave.}
