<pre>o do next?**

1. {Approach and identify yourself quietly. "Cheng. I followed. You okay?"}
2. {Stay hidden. Watch her for another 30 seconds. Maybe she's not alone.}
3. {Prepare a juice shield in advance. Enter visibly, but protected.}
4. {Check the Baroque Works agent first-see if he's dead or faking.}
5. {Retreat slightly. Juice-mark this chamber. Tashigi's alive. Time to get backup or go deeper.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 2 / 3. Lay in the shadows, but start accumulating kiwi juice in one hand, and draw my baton (unextended) in the other. Who knows what might happen.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 2/3 Hybrid Selected - "Stay low. Stay hidden. Juice in one hand. Baton in the other."**  
**🎭 Tone: Predator's Patience | Internal: Fully Alert, Expecting Ambush**  
**🎲 Stealth Hold Roll - (Eatone +2 Subtle, +1 Cautious Prep) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**🎲 Juice Pooling Roll - (Eatone +1 Control, +1 Prepared Terrain, +1 Devil Fruit Focus) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Passive Perception Roll - (Eatone +2 Juice-Sense, +1 Combat Instinct) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**✅ Outcome: You're hidden, fully prepared, and you spot the threat *before it strikes.***

---

You slip into the shadows near a low **utility pipe** that runs along the ceiling drop-crouched just behind a rusted **ventilation grate**, vision perfect for this stretch of hallway. You let out a slow breath, calming your pulse, just like during *those "parent-teacher meetings" where the angry dads smelled like whiskey and poor choices.*

You extend your **left hand** just slightly, palm down, and begin pooling a tight, coiled orb of **high-density kiwi juice**, each drop refined and precise. A pale green glow begins to shimmer under your palm, like **liquid courage under moonlight.**

Your **right hand** slips to your baton-still collapsed, but Seastone tip ready to snap open with a flick. The grip is worn smooth from handling, like the edge of a desk you've rapped for silence a hundred times.

> *Juice for shield or trap. Baton for things that don't respond to juice.*

You watch Tashigi from the shadows. She **hasn't seen you.**  
She's breathing steadily now. Her head turns, slowly scanning. She knows someone else *might* be nearby.

That's when your **juice-sense flares.**

Not from her. Not from the body.

> From **above.**

Your breath catches.

The ceiling panel **three meters behind her**-one of the vent ducts-is **open.** Just slightly. **Condensation trails**-thin trickles of moisture out of place in the dry desert air-slither down the edge.

You hold your breath and shift your focus.

### There's someone **in the ceiling.**

Alive. Silent. Moving slow. Maybe **waiting to strike.** Maybe **already watching her.** Maybe **watching you.**

**You see a flash of black boot leather.**

Tashigi hasn't noticed. She's vulnerable.

You? You're **armed. Primed. Hidden.**  
And the air is getting **very, very still.**

---

**📝 Tactical Summary:**

- You are **completely hidden.**  
- You have **a prepared ball of kiwi juice** (choice of shield, trap, or directed strike).  
- You have your **collapsed Seastone baton** in hand.  
- Tashigi is unaware of the ceiling threat.  
- You have **the jump. One clean action before they move.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Hurl the juice upward into the vent. Flush them out. Strike first.}
2. {Extend the baton *quietly*, prep for a physical ambush. Wait until they drop.}
3. {Use the juice to *trap the vent exit*, sealing them in with an adhesive flood.}
4. {Hiss softly: "Marine-above you." Alert Tashigi. Lose surprise, gain ally readiness.}
5. {Split the juice-some into the vent, some into a wall trail to *listen* for movement inside. Buy yourself info.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option X - Prime my juice hand, ready to launch a juicy surprise at whatever comes out of the ceiling.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option X Selected - "Let 'em drop. I've got a juice-packed surprise with their name on it."**  
**🎭 Tone: Silent Readiness | Stance: Predator in the Dark**  
**🎲 Held Action - Juice Launch (Eatone +1 Devil Fruit Control, +1 Prepared Strike, +1 Surprise) = *Primed, Ready to Release***  
**🎲 Environmental Check - Ceiling Panel Stability = Result: Loose. Unsecured.**  
**🎲 Enemy Stealth Roll - (+2 Trained, -2 Moisture Signature) = Result: 0 [Mediocre]**  
**✅ Outcome: You've readied a perfect ambush. You're one move ahead. And they're about to drop into your strike zone.**

---

Your muscles coil with the stillness of a veteran field exam proctor who's just spotted the kid with a cheat sheet under the desk.

You don't move-not a flinch, not a breath.  
Your **juice orb grows**, dense and slightly steaming in your palm. You concentrate it down to a **tight, pulsing bundle** of semi-solid kiwi pressure. Thick with **natural acids and sticky fruit pulp**, it's ideal for one thing:

> *Neutralizing targets without killing them. Unless they're allergic. In which case-oops.*

The air shifts.

The ceiling panel just above and behind Tashigi **creaks.**  
One **black-gloved hand** appears, gripping the edge. **Silent. Deliberate.**

Then a second hand.  
Then-**a masked face.**

White mask. Gold trim.  
A **Baroque Works elite agent.** You still don't know what that means... but it **sure as hell ain't a stylist.**

He moves with care-likely thinks Tashigi's too disoriented to detect him.

> But he doesn't know *you're here.*

You see it:

- His **knife is drawn**.  
- He's about to drop onto her with **deadly precision.**  
- He's **three seconds from committing to the kill.**

---

**You may now release your held action.**

Choose how to launch the juice:

1. {Direct shot to the face - blind, sting, disorient. Disable immediately.}  
2. {Blast his hands - knock the knife loose, force him to fall unarmed.}  
3. {Spray the vent - cover the exit and seal it. Trap him before he drops.}  
4. {Launch upward and trigger a sticky *shockwave* in the vent. Flush him out hard.}  
5. {Let him fall. Hit him the *moment* he lands-less risk to ceiling, more drama.}

🌀 {Choose how you unleash the juice.}

>> USER: Option 1 - Kiwi away! Draw my baton and move in.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected - "Kiwi Away!"**  
**Action: Direct Strike to the Face | Follow-Up: Close Quarters Engagement**  
**🎲 Attack Roll - (Eatone +2 Devil Fruit Aim, +1 Surprise, +1 Close Range) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎲 Enemy Defense Roll - (+2 Trained Reflexes, -3 Didn't Know You Were There) = Result: -1 [Disastrous]**  
**✅ Outcome: Critical Ambush Success - He never sees it coming. You disable him instantly.**

As the **masked Baroque Works assassin** begins to drop, arms poised like a venomous spider falling from its silk-

> **"Kiwi away."**

You flick your wrist, and the dense, acidic orb of concentrated kiwi juice blasts from your palm with surgical force. The air ripples, the juice hisses, and the projectile **slams directly into his mask**.

> *THWAP-SSSSHHHH-KRAK*

The impact is wet and sharp. The mask cracks down the middle. The acidic kiwi pulp **floods his eyes**, stinging, blinding, soaking the seams of his mask and armor with a **sticky, enzymatic coating**.

He doesn't scream-he *gurgles*.

He drops wildly from the vent-not a strike, not a lunge, but a **crash.**

Tashigi's eyes go wide as a body thuds to the floor next to her.

> "Wha-?!"

Before the agent can even roll, you're **moving**-one step, two, **baton snapping open with a metal *CLACK*** as you swing around the corner and stride into full view.

> *Teacher mode: activated.*

Your **Seastone-tipped baton** extends, cold and humming with lethality. You advance on the now-writhing assassin, who claws at his eyes, slipping on kiwi pulp as he tries to right himself.

Tashigi looks up from her position, blinking rapidly.

> "You...?!"

You nod once, firm.

> "Cheng. Room 703. Just here to make sure nobody stabs a Marine in the back."

She blinks.

> "...That's a hell of a vacation."
