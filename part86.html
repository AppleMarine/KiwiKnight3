<pre>s mobilize.
- Tashigi has become your **unofficial sponsor**, protector, and chronicler.
- Smoker is **watching carefully**, but not antagonistic-for now.

Would you like to:

1. {Time skip - you waking up, well-fed and bandaged.}  
2. {Continue with more interludes - Straw Hats, Vivi, Cobra.}  
3. {A private moment with Tashigi, later that night.}

>> USER: Option 2 and 3

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - A City at Peace, and a Sword at Rest]**  
**Scenes: "The Last Rounds" & "The Night Watch"**  
**Tone: Winding Down | Mood: Joy, Reflection, and Something Unspoken**

---

### **Scene I: The Last Rounds**  
**POV: Straw Hats, Vivi, Cobra**  

---

**The palace banquet hall**, despite half a wall missing and everything reeking faintly of kiwi concentrate, is lively with celebration.

The Straw Hats-**bless their chaotic, dehydrated, emotionally compromised hearts**-have taken full advantage of the king's hospitality.

---

- **Luffy** is inhaling mountains of food, only occasionally stopping to yell "PONEGLYPH!" across the hall for no reason.  
- **Zoro** is arguing with a palace guard about sword technique while double-fisting watermelon.  
- **Nami** has charmed half the royal treasury team and is "accidentally" discussing debt forgiveness rates.  
- **Usopp** is loudly recounting the battle, only now with added laser beams.  
- **Sanji** is serving Vivi and every female staff member. Shirt unbuttoned. Fully in "I am the rose of Alabasta" mode.  
- **Chopper**, bandaged but fine, is being **held like a plushie** by three noble children and looks helplessly content.

---

**Vivi and Cobra**, seated together at the head table, are quiet now. The adrenaline's worn off.

---

> "They're unbelievable," Vivi says, watching the crew.

> "They're a miracle," Cobra corrects softly.  
> "...And so was that man you brought in."

---

Vivi doesn't speak at first.

Then:

> "He never wanted to be here. He was scared. But he still jumped in front of me."

> "Twice."

She smiles quietly.

> "I think he'd rather forget the whole thing happened."

---

Cobra hums.

> "Then we won't forget for him."

---

### **Scene II: The Night Watch**  
**POV: Tashigi**

---

The moon is high, and most of the palace has settled.

Except for one room.

A quiet **guest chamber**, dimly lit by a small lantern. The walls are decorated with humble banners from the royal school system-placed there by Vivi herself.

On the bed: **Eatone Cheng**.

Still snoring. Face half-buried in the **most luxurious pillow known to man**. Fresh bandages. A tray of food untouched nearby. His coat is folded, still sticky.

---

**Tashigi stands at the window**, arms crossed, sword set aside for once.

She hasn't said a word in hours.

She just... watches.

---

At one point, you **shift in your sleep**, mumbling something.

> "...No, not the test... I didn't curve it hard enough..."

---

Tashigi smirks faintly.

> "Even in sleep, you're grading people..."

She walks over. Pulls the blanket up just slightly higher.

Stands there a long moment, unsure of what to say.

Finally-

> "You were brave."

> "And stupid."

> "And brave again."

---

She kneels at the side of the bed, arms resting on her legs. Sword back in reach, but relaxed.

> "You can rest now, Sensei."

> "You saved the kids."

---

And for the first time in what feels like a century, she **lets herself close her eyes** too.

Just for a moment.

Just to make sure you're really there.

---

**OOC:**
- The Straw Hats celebrate their strange victory.  
- Cobra and Vivi reflect on what was lost-and saved.  
- Tashigi stands vigil, loyal and quiet.  

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {You finally wake up. Morning after.}  
2. {Straw Hat departure & Vivi's goodbye.}  
3. {Private moment between you and Vivi.}

>> USER: Option 3 - Vivi intrudes late in the night and notices Tashigi passed out next to my bed, head resting near my arm

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing - Night's Gentle Silence]**  
**Scene: "The Two Who Stayed"**  
**POV: Vivi Nefertari**  
**Tone: Intimate | Mood: Quiet Bonds and Unshed Emotion**

---

The **palace is asleep.**

Even the **wounded city** seems to have taken a breath it hadn't dared since the fighting began.

---

**Vivi**, still dressed in her royal shawl but now barefoot and with her hair loosely braided down her back, tiptoes through the guest wing. A small basket of fruit and fresh bread is tucked in her arms-**an excuse**, perhaps, more than a gesture.

She hasn't seen you since the battle ended.

Not really.

And she hasn't slept either.

---

She stops at the door to your room.

Hesitates.

Pushes it open, just a little.

The lantern inside flickers low-warm, soft. Like a memory that won't quite leave.

---

What she sees makes her pause in the doorway, lips parting in a breathless little oh.

---

**You**, lying on the bed.  
Still, save for a twitch or a mumble here and there.

And beside you?

**Tashigi.**

Fully dressed, armor long since doffed, head gently resting on the mattress near your arm-almost **as if she had fallen asleep mid-vigil**, one hand still resting atop the hilt of her blade, the other brushing **accidentally close** to your own.

---

Vivi stands there, caught in a moment she hadn't expected.

---

There's nothing romantic about it.

And yet-

There's something **tender**.

Something **real.**

The kind of loyalty that doesn't need words or glory. Just time. Just quiet.

---

She steps in carefully, setting down the food near the windowsill.

Then looks at you-pale, wrapped in gauze, drooling just a bit into a stupidly fancy pillow-and lets out the tiniest laugh.

---

> "Still the hero of Alabasta, huh?"

She whispers.

> "You've got one woman watching your left, and another bringing you snacks."

---

She sits softly in the chair by the window, resting her chin on her hand, eyes never leaving the pair of you.

And in that silence-

She doesn't feel quite so alone anymore.

---

**OOC:**
- Vivi has seen what you mean to Tashigi.
- She doesn't interrupt-she **joins the quiet**, for now.
- The palace sleeps, but the people you saved? They remain by your side.

Would you like next scene to be:

1. {You waking up to both of them.}
2. {Time skip - The farewell scene begins.}
3. {Tashigi waking to find Vivi already there.}

>> USER: Option X - continue the scene a little longer. Vivi may doze off after a bit as well

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing - A Room of Quiet Devotion]**  
**Scene: "The Three That Stayed"**  
**POV: None - Ambient Narrative**  
**Tone: Dreamlike | Mood: Stillness, Comfort, Found Family**

---

The quiet in the room becomes a living thing.

Not heavy, not oppressive.

Just **full**-with breath, and healing, and the warmth of people who *stayed*.

---

**Tashigi** stirs briefly, her hand curling slightly near yours.

Still half-asleep. Still too stubborn to admit she needs rest.

But her eyes flutter open for a moment, long enough to see **Vivi** seated nearby.

Their eyes meet.

No words exchanged.

Just a soft, mutual nod.

---

Tashigi shifts closer to the edge of the bed again, returning her forehead to rest by your arm.

One eye still cracked open-because **someone has to be the sword**, even in dreams.

---

**Vivi**, meanwhile, sits with her knees pulled up onto the chair, arms wrapped around them.

She watches your chest rise and fall.

The shallow rhythm.

The hint of strain.

And the calm in your brow.

---

She doesn't remember when her eyelids began to droop.

Or when her head gently slumped to the window frame.

---

But sometime between the hour and the hush, **she too drifts.**

---

Now the room holds three figures.

- One **asleep out of exhaustion**.  
- One **asleep out of loyalty**.  
- One **asleep out of love**-or something on the road to it.

---

Outside, the city dreams with them.

No war.  
No revolution.  
No Warlords.

Just breath.  
And quiet.  
And the cool night wind passing through the cracked palace, smelling faintly of crus</pre>
