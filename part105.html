---

You press a hand to your stomach-**not hard**, just enough to feel that lingering ache beneath the gauze.  
It's not the pain of battle anymore.  
It's the pain of ***recovery.***  
The slow rebuild.  
The echo of what it meant to survive.

---

> "I'll join you soon," you murmur to **Tashigi**, after finishing the last of your tea.

> "Just need to walk breakfast off. Still sore from all the... crocodile wrestling."

She narrows her eyes, but there's no fire behind them-just quiet understanding.

> "Try not to duel any cactus on the way."

---

You flash a faint grin, then excuse yourself, stepping through a side corridor that opens into a space **you hadn't explored yet.**

---

**The Palace Gardens.**

---

You expect sand.  
Maybe a few succulents.  
Dry statues.  
Something pretty in a *stoic* way.

What you get instead is **an explosion of subtle color**, perfectly woven into the sun-drenched desert aesthetic.

---

Rows of **prickly pear cactus**-tall and proud, but covered in soft pink blossoms.  
Trailing **succulents** curl like silver-green serpents through sandstone planters.  
A narrow **reflecting pool** glints between shaded arches, its surface still-catching the morning light like it was made of glass.

And in the center...

A massive **Barrel Cactus**, flowering with vibrant orange blooms, its base surrounded by **handwritten name plaques**.

> "Veteran. Hero. Mother. Friend."

You pause there a while.

---

A nearby gardener nods at you once.

> "That one's dedicated to everyone we lost before the revolution ended."

> "Cactus live a long time. Hard to kill."

> "Just like the people we built this kingdom with."

---

You thank him softly, and continue wandering.

Past butterflies nesting on aloe.  
Past warm desert stones that radiate a steady heat.  
Past a group of palace kids being led by a nursemaid, who points at you and whispers something, causing them to all **giggle and hide behind her skirts.**

---

You find a **low bench in the shade**, take a breath, and sit.

For a moment-

There's no war.  
No duty.  
No pain.

Just the faint smell of sand and citrus.

And a peace that feels like it's *earned*, not borrowed.

---

**OOC:**
You may rest here as long as you wish.

When you're ready:

1. {Rejoin Tashigi and the Marines in the training yard.}  
2. {Continue exploring the palace alone. Maybe you're not done being surprised.}  
3. {Be found by someone who wasn't done talking to you.}

>> USER: Option X - I see I missed the vigil for the fallen (While I was passed out.)

I read the names.

Pell, killed while attempting to rescue the princessat Rainbase. Huh, looks like there was a rescue operation in parallel back at the casino that didn't succeed. I should count Tashigi and I lucky.

Igaram, presumed dead after his ship exploded while acting as a body double for the princess at Whiskey Peak.

And countless more.

I stare solemnly. Quietly.

---

The laughter of the children fades behind you.  
The sun climbs higher, casting warm gold across the stones.  
You turn your head, just slightly-just enough to notice the small **carved stone pedestal** tucked beneath the blooming barrel cactus.

A simple plaque of dark sandstone, not grand or gilded.

But the engraving is fresh.

The names?

**Sharp. Clean. Real.**

---

You lean down.

Eyes scanning one line at a time.

---

> **Pell - Royal Guard Falcon Division, Decorated Hero**  
> *"Fell in defense of the Princess during the Rainbase rescue attempt."*

---

Your eyes narrow.

You hadn't heard that part.

Somewhere-while you and Tashigi were bleeding through hotel corridors and sewers and sand-filled death traps-*others* had tried to get to her too.

And they failed.

---

> **Igaram - Royal Advisor, Captain of the Guard**  
> *"Presumed lost at sea. Disguised himself as the Princess to protect her escape from Whiskey Peak."*

---

You recognize the name from Vivi's lips, once.

She mentioned it softly.

With a tone that **cracked** and was quickly pushed down.

He was **the first shield she ever had**.

The one who taught her to wield her voice before she could wield her status.

---

You keep reading.

Line after line.

Names that don't belong in textbooks or songs.

Names of **messengers**.

**Gatekeepers.**

**Couriers.**

**Cooks.**

**A teenage rebel scout** named Farim who carried the wrong flag at the wrong time.

**A gardener** who shielded a child with her body during the bombing at Erumalu.

---

They're all listed here.

Not in marble.

But in the shade of a **living thing.**

A cactus that might prick your fingers if you reached for it wrong.

But one that blooms anyway.

Every season.

Without fail.

---

You stand there.

For a long time.

Saying nothing.

Because what could you say?

You lived.

They didn't.

You tried.

They tried harder.

---

And yet... in your chest, in the ache behind your ribs, something pulses with that truth.

**You're here.**

And *because* you're here, **they aren't forgotten.**

Not today.

Not by you.

---

**A small voice breaks the silence.**

One of the palace children has crept up behind you.

Big eyes.

No shoes.

A tiny flower in their hand.

They offer it up, silently.

A purple bloom from a wild aloe.

---

> "For Mister Pell," the child says, shyly. "He flew really good."

---

You nod, wordless, and help them lay it at the base of the cactus.

Then, quietly...

You sit.

And **you remember them all.**

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Let the moment pass naturally and rejoin Tashigi.}  
2. {Wait here longer-maybe you're not ready yet.}  
3. {Be joined by someone who's grieving too.}

>> USER: Option 2 - And why was I the lucky one? I'm just a tourist. A face in the crowd.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Gardens - Beneath the Names That Stayed]**  
**Scene: "Why Me?"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Introspective | Mood: Heavy, Survivor's Weight, Quiet Confession**

---

You stay seated on the low stone step near the cactus, elbows on your knees, fingers loosely laced.

The desert wind brushes past, warm but not cruel. It shifts the petals of the flower the child left behind. You watch it wobble slightly, then settle again-**resilient**, like everything else in this kingdom.

And you ask yourself:

> "Why me?"

---

The others were soldiers.  
Lifelong guards.  
Revolutionaries.  
Loyalists.

Heroes.

---

You were a **man on vacation**.

You had a schoolbag. A travel voucher. A laminated fruit sticker that still won't come off your wallet.

You were supposed to sip daiquiris by the fountain. Maybe write lesson plans. Grade homework. Complain about the humidity.

Not this.

---

You look at your hands.

Calloused, yes.

But not meant for **saving nations.**

You murmur it quietly, like admitting it too loudly might tear the garden open:

> "I'm just a tourist."

> "A face in the crowd."

---

Your voice sounds small out here.

Like it doesn't deserve to take up space next to these names.

---

And yet...

You *were* the one who saw a girl sneaking down a corridor and didn't look away.

You *were* the one who turned back after the camel cab, even when you could've left.

You *were* the one who stood between a cannonball and a child.

You *were* the one who didn't drink the Hero Water...

Because you didn't want to be a **martyr.**

You just wanted to be a **grown-up who stayed.**

---

And maybe that's it.

Maybe the reason you're alive isn't **fair**.

Maybe it isn't **just**.

Maybe it's not because you're *more brave* or *more worthy*.

---

Maybe you just...

**Chose not to leave.**

And somehow, when you did that-

The world **changed around you.**

---

The cactus rustles again.

You exhale.

The burn behind your eyes doesn't ask permission-it just shows up.
