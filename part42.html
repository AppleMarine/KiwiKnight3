<pre>nd you, wind whips against the canvas. The **Sandora River glimmers on the horizon**, a massive, winding slash of water that separates the desert from the capital beyond.

You're almost there.

Almost at the heart of the war.  
Almost at the place where your *vacation* ends, one way or another.

---

Tashigi glances at you one last time.

> "You say you're just a guy.  
But if you hadn't been there, there'd be six graves under Rain Dinners."

A beat.

> "So... just know that. Before you vanish."

---

She says nothing else.  
Returns to steering the skiff.

But she said enough.

---

**You've made an impression.  
Whether you stay or not-she won't forget what you did.  
And neither will you.**

The dunes begin to flatten. The water grows closer.  
You hear a distant *boom*.

Baroque Works is coming.

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Go to Vivi. The time to plan for Alubarna is now. She'll know where to start.}  
2. {Scout the horizon. You heard that explosion-Baroque agents may already be ahead.}  
3. {Sit beside Tashigi again. Say nothing. Just stay a moment longer.}  
4. {Crack a joke. Cut the tension before it hardens.}  
5. {Ready your weapon. You're not running yet. Not if they still need you.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: OOC - Vivi may choose to join in the conversation.

I stare awkwardly at Tashigi, not expecting her response.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Desert Skiff - Approaching the Sandora | Scene: Words That Linger]**  
**Tone: Emotional Tension | Mood: Quiet Shock, Mutual Recognition**

---

You stare at her.

Awkward. Caught off guard.

Tashigi doesn't meet your eyes again. Not after that.  
She just grips the rudder and keeps her gaze forward-like that whole confession didn't just happen, like she didn't just lay bare how much you've shaken her idea of what a "civilian" can be.

You don't know what to say.

You've faced **Warlords**, **Banana Gators**, and **piles of bureaucratic paperwork back at the school**. But this?  
Someone telling you that *you mattered?*

> That's harder to deflect than a punch.

---

You're still stuck in that moment when **Vivi's voice cuts gently through the wind.**

She steps quietly to your side, her expression soft, gaze forward-toward the capital she's fighting to save, but her voice entirely focused on you.

> "You said you're just a guy."

She pauses.

> "But you were one of the first people in that casino who treated me like someone *worth protecting*, not someone to use or control."

She smiles faintly, the corners of her mouth twitching upward-but there's sadness there.

> "I've been a princess my whole life. I've had soldiers, guards, advisors... and a *lot* of pirates lately."

She glances between you and Tashigi.

> "But it was a *schoolteacher*, covered in juice, who stood in front of a Warlord and helped pull me out of a cage."

She gives a small nod, polite, but sincere.

> "I don't think there's anything â€˜just' about that."

---

You are now officially at **peak emotional disarmament**.

Two strong women-one a Marine, one a royal-just told you the same thing:

> You made a difference.

And your plans to vanish?

They're starting to feel a little **less clean.**

---

Tashigi still doesn't say anything.  
But from the corner of your eye, you see her glance your way again.

She didn't expect Vivi to say that.

And now she's *definitely* waiting to hear what you say next.

---

**You have the floor again.**  
What do you say, Cheng?

>> USER: Princess, I... You got the Marines (I gesture at Tashigi). The royal army (I gesture at the horizon). And apparently, the pir- (I glance at the snoring Luffy), nevermind. I'm just a wrong vacationer in the right time. I think your impression of me might be a little... High.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Desert Skiff - Heart of the Sandstorm]**  
**Tone: Deflection and Doubt | Mood: Humble Heart, Cracks Showing Through**

---

> "Princess, I..."

You start, hand lifting a little uncertainly, caught between gratitude and guilt.

> "You've got the Marines,"  
You gesture at Tashigi, who doesn't blink, just watches.  
> "The royal army..."  
You wave toward the hazy horizon-where somewhere, **Koza** is marching with a fury stoked by lies.  
> "And apparently the pir-"

Your eyes drift to **Luffy**, dead asleep with his hat over his face, drooling into his collarbone like a melted wax statue of chaos.

> "Nevermind."

That gets a small breath of laughter from **Vivi**, more exhale than sound-but real.

---

You shrug, quietly.

> "I'm just a wrong vacationer in the right time."

Then you glance at her.  
At both of them.

> "I think your impression of me might be a little... high."

---

**Vivi** looks at you-longer this time. Searching. The way a princess has to evaluate generals. Or strangers who became shields.

> "You know," she says gently, "my father always told me...  
that the people who change the course of wars the most are the ones who *don't want to be there.*"

A pause.

> "They fight *only* because it's right.  
And when it's over, they walk away."

She shrugs, smile turning wistful.

> "But people like that never really vanish. They just... show up again when the next storm hits."

---

Tashigi doesn't speak, but she exhales slowly-eyes closing for a second, like some tiny part of her tension just loosened.

Not all.

But enough.

---

Then-

> **BOOM.**

Far ahead, across the rolling dunes, a column of **smoke and sand erupts upward**, followed by the distant thunder of **hoofbeats** and the glint of **steel catching sun**.

The Sandora River glimmers in the foreground.

And now you can see them.

**Baroque Works**.

They're here.

And **they're ahead of you**.

---

**OOC Update:**

- Emotional tension: Softened. You remain humble, but their belief in you has *crystallized*.  
- Vivi and Tashigi see you for what you are: **unwilling, unrelenting, undeniably part of the fight.**  
- You have now approached the **Sandora River crossing**-the narrow point before the final sprint to **Alubarna**.  
- **Baroque agents** are waiting across the far bank. Possibly Mr. 2. Possibly worse.

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Draw your baton. "Guess it's showtime again."}  
2. {Glance at Tashigi. "Still think I'm just a tourist?"}  
3. {Walk to the bow and scout the enemy. Let the moment pass.}  
4. {Crack your knuckles. "Okay. Let's ruin some bounty hunter careers."}  
5. {Stay still. Wait for the group to react first. This isn't your crew-but they're counting on you.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 5 - Oh dear. Move protectively in front of Vivi, scanning for snipers. 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River Skiff - On the Edge of Ambush]**  
**Tone: Quiet Instinct | Mood: Protector Mode Engaged**

---

> *Boom.*  
> *Smoke.*  
> *Glint of steel.*

And before anyone can speak, you **move.**

A practiced step forward-nothing dramatic, nothing shouted-just calm, immediate **protectiveness**.

You place yourself **between Vivi and the distant chaos**, eyes narrowing as you scan the dunes across the river.

Not for soldiers.

> For snipers.

---

**Your eyes flick from ridge to ridge**, watching for the shimmer of a scope, the silhouette of a crouched figure. A telltale **glint**, a hint of **barrel** in shadow, a ridge of **kicking up sand** with no wind-

Nothing yet.

But this reeks of a trap.

And *you've taught enough kids to know* when someone is trying to pick off the smart ones first.

> You don't say anything to Vivi.  
Just stand there.  
Just watch.

**She notices.**

Doesn't speak.  
But her hand brushes lightly against your coat as she steps subtly behind you.

---

**Tashigi** catches your movement. She tightens her grip on her sword and nods silently, sliding sideways to cover your flank.

**Zoro** squints ahead. "They're not just waiting. They're *hunting.*"

**Nami** curses under her breath. "If they've already crossed, the river's not a barrier-it's bait."

**Luffy** still sleeps. For now.

---

Across the Sandora, **dust kicks up** again.
