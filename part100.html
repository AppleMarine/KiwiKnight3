<pre>reated a bond.

One born of shared weight, of survival, of care freely given and finally returned.

When you're ready, we'll move to your first day as a permanent citizen of Alabasta... or wherever this strange, beautiful journey takes you next.

Until then?

You sit in the quiet, hand in hand with the future.

>> USER: Follow Vivi back to the palace, then return to my guest room to turn in for the night (after I light shower)

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Nightfall's End]**  
**Scene: "The Walk Home"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Serene | Mood: Earned Peace, Gentle Fatigue, Mutual Understanding**

---

Eventually, your hand untangles from hers.

Not because the moment breaks.

But because, like all things-even grief, even war, even nights like this-*it has to move forward.*

---

Vivi rises first, brushing a speck of dust off her sleeve, and tilts her head toward the palace with a soft smile.

> "Come on, Pineapple."

---

You groan with theatrical agony, getting up far too slowly for someone your age.

> "I swear if one more person calls me that..."

She's already walking, giggling over her shoulder.

You follow.

Of course you do.

---

The walk back is quiet.

**Not heavy. Not awkward.**

Just the kind of silence that settles between people who've said what mattered-and now simply *exist beside each other.*

---

The palace is dimmed for the night, torches flickering low.

A few guards nod as you pass.

No one asks where you've been.

No one has to.

---

You split ways at the upper hall-Vivi with a smile and a small wave, her steps lighter than when the night began.

You offer a quiet salute in return, then shuffle into your guest room, peeling your jacket off your shoulders with the careful slowness of a man who's learned *exactly how much pain he's willing to tolerate before complaining.*

---

Your room is clean now.  
Fresh linens. A carafe of water.  
Someone even folded your jacket from earlier and placed it neatly on the side table-  
**...still faintly green.**

---

You grunt. Strip off your shirt.  
Head to the bath tucked off to the side.

It's not deep.  
Not royal.  
But the water's warm, and it washes away a bit more than dirt.

**The juice, the blood, the fear.**  
Some of it goes with the steam.  
Some of it stays.

But not all.

Not anymore.

---

You towel off slowly. Stretch once. Crack something in your shoulder that probably wasn't meant to crack.

And then?

You sink into the bed.

Sheets cool.

Body aching.

But... heart a little steadier.

---

You stare at the ceiling for a long time.

Until your thoughts drift from logistics...

To smiles.

To lanterns.

To breakfast invitations.

---

And with the scent of citrus still faint in your hair...

**You sleep.**

For the first time in weeks-

**Without fear.**

---

**OOC: Let me know when you're ready for the next morning-your first full day as an Alabastan resident.**

>> USER: My eyes burst open at the first hint of sunlight. 

I below OH CRAP I'M GOING TO MISS MY SHIP TO RAIN DINNERS I OVERSLEPT

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Guest Room - Morning Panic]**  
**Scene: "Muscle Memory Meltdown"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Comedy | Mood: Chaos, Disorientation, Wholesome Aftershock**

---

**The first ray of sunlight** barely crests over the alabaster stone of your window before-

> "OH CRAP I'M GOING TO MISS MY SHIP TO RAIN DINNERS!"

**You bolt upright.**

Eyes wild.

Breath short.

Sheets wrapped around one leg like you were mid-combat.

> "I OVERSLEPT!"

You kick off the tangle of blankets, sending a decorative throw pillow flying into a carved column hard enough to dislodge a small framed portrait of a very judgmental-looking cobra in formalwear.

---

You hit the floor with a *thud*, half naked, one sock still on from yesterday, and adrenaline pumping like the **Warlord is back for Round Two.**

> "Where's my confirmation voucher-where's my-my sandals, where's my-WHERE'S THE JUICE??"

---

You grab for your belt, then pause, blinking as your brain slowly boots up.

**You're not in Rainbase.**

You're not in a hotel.

You're in a palace.

In **Alubarna.**

Your **home.**

You blink again.

> "...Right."

You rub your eyes.

> "Rain Dinners was *a crime syndicate.*"

A pause.

> "They're very likely... *not accepting guests anymore.*"

---

You exhale, dramatically flopping back onto the bed, arms splayed.

---

Then you hear it.

From outside your door-

**Soft laughter.**

Not mocking.

Not cruel.

But definitely **entertained**.

---

> "Is he... always like this in the morning?" comes Vivi's voice, muffled through the stone.

> "He has the *exact* energy of a seagull who forgot how flying works," adds Tashigi, completely deadpan.

---

You groan into your pillow.

Loudly.

---

**OOC: Welcome to your first morning as an Alabastan resident.**

Would you like to:

1. {Get dressed and join them for breakfast, as promised.}
2. {Try to regain your dignity before opening that door.}
3. {Call through the door: "I meant to do that."}

>> USER: Option 2, then 1.

I put on my coat, stained, worn... And probably not sometime I should wear to a palace breakfast. I do have a sense of decorum, after all. Put on some helpfully provided clothes (nearly folded on a countertop) and open the door

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - The Hallway of Judgement & Juice Residue]**  
**Scene: "Dressed for Breakfast, Not Battle"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Dryly Comedic | Mood: Light, Warm, Slightly Dignified (But Barely)**

---

You lie there a second longer, face-first in the pillow, trying to recover what shreds of dignity you may or may not have *yeeted into orbit* moments earlier.

Then, with a long, suffering sigh, you sit up again.

Slowly this time.

No wild flailing.

No declarations of fictional cruise departures.

---

You eye your coat-the one with the **multiple juice stains**, a **ripped shoulder seam**, and something that may or may not be **Bananagator teeth marks** near the hem.

You pick it up, study it solemnly.

> "You've done your duty, soldier."

You fold it neatly and set it aside on a nearby chair.

It somehow exhales like it's grateful.

---

Your gaze shifts to the other side of the room-where a fresh, neatly folded **set of clothes** waits for you.

A simple but elegant white shirt. A light linen vest with silver-thread trim. Trousers that actually *fit*. And a deep blue sash with an Alabastan crest subtly embroidered at the end.

You blink.

> "Wow. I look... *employable.*"

---

Five minutes later, your hair's been smoothed.  
Your bandages are hidden under your shirt.  
And the man in the mirror looks like someone who *might* be here for breakfast and *not* to defuse a hostage situation with fruit.

---

You reach the door, exhale, then open it.

---

Standing across the hall-

**Vivi and Tashigi.**

Both still in semi-casual morning wear-Vivi with a light breakfast shawl, and Tashigi in the same button-down from last night, rolled sleeves, mug of hot tea in hand.

They both blink at you.

Then **Tashigi raises an eyebrow.**

> "Wow."

She sips her tea.

> "You clean up like you're about to run for Parliament."

---

**Vivi grins, warm and wide.**

> "You look nice."

---

You scratch the back of your head sheepishly.

> "Thought I'd try not showing up like a juice-stained war criminal for once."

---

**Tashigi smirks.**

> "That's good. I think we're fresh out of royal pardons."

---

**Vivi offers her arm, jokingly.**

> "Shall we, Sir Cheng?"

---

And for once-

No explosions.

No sandstorms.

No blood on the cuffs.

Just the scent of fresh bread wafting from the palace kitchens...

...and two women smiling like this day-**finally**-gets to be normal.

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Go to breakfast and catch up on post-war plans.}
2. {Run into an unexpected guest in the dining hall.}
3. {Let the meal settle into something quiet-comfort, connection, and warmth.}

>> USER: Awkwardly take the arm. 

Option 2 - Cobra is in the royal dining hall and wat</pre>
