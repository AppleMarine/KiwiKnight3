<pre>still look like they're running *silent tactical calculations* on how many steps it would take to reach your neck, break it, *then* ask Cobra if it was necessary.

One near the door starts inching sideways.

The *door* itself seems to be debating whether it wants to stay open for the eventual emergency medics.

---

But you?

Totally composed.

Except for the faint, microscopic trickle of sweat *just* under your collar.  
Not enough for royalty to comment on.  
But enough for **Tashigi**, who sits beside you *muttering like she's trying to pray you into custody.*

---

> "You're impossible."

> "Actual warlord bait."

> "You just *assaulted the king.*"

---

You reply without turning your head.

> "Lightly."

---

**Vivi**, meanwhile, is still recovering.

Her laughter has settled into bright, stunned chuckles as she leans on the table, eyes sparkling in the way only someone who *just witnessed the most polite act of domestic terrorism in history* can manage.

---

> "I didn't think you'd actually do it," she says through a grin.  
> "I thought it was just something you said in the moment."

You glance at her.

> "I'm a teacher."

> "You threaten to break a politician's knees in front of a kid, you *follow through.*"

---

**Cobra**, still nursing a phantom twinge in his knee, lifts his teacup in your direction.

> "I'll be sure to wear reinforced guards to the next cabinet meeting. Just in case you feel another moral obligation."

---

You smile back, faintly.

Then take another sip.

Totally not trembling.

At all.

---

**The room slowly returns to its normal rhythm.**

Honeycakes are passed.

Tea is refilled.

And you-teacher, bounty hunter, unofficial Alabastan folk legend, **first of your name to commit knee treason**-sit among royalty, warriors, and revolutionaries...

Like you belong.

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Continue breakfast with some "what now?" talk about your future.}  
2. {Excuse yourself and take a walk with one of them afterward.}  
3. {Stay quiet, let them lead the conversation. You've said enough for now.}

>> USER: Option 3 - Politely sip on tea. Listen in on any conversation that the others have.

OOC: Tashigi (and Smoker's) unit are to remain in Alabasta for the time being to help with reconstruction and security.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Dining Hall, Wiser in Silence]**

**POV: You**  
**Tone: Observant | Mood: Warm, Reflective, Quietly Important**

---

Your cup rests lightly in your hand.  
Tea-lukewarm now, but fragrant-gives you something to hold onto. Something neutral. Familiar.

You lean back.

**Not from weariness.**

From *completion.*

From the comfort of knowing that for once-you can simply **be**.

---

You let the conversation **flow around you.**

You listen.

You watch.

And the world begins to **continue** without needing to be saved for a while.

---

### 👑 **King Cobra**, voice deep, firm but gentle:

> "Marshal headquarters acknowledged the communication blackout. Vice Admirals from Marine G-2 should arrive within the week to assess the reconstruction."

He cuts a honeycake carefully, his tone even.

> "I've asked them to delay any punitive action toward Alabasta's civilian population. We are recovering from war. We do not need posturing."

---

### ⚔️ **Tashigi**, still sitting beside you, a bit stiff-but not unpleasant:

> "Captain Smoker's unit is staying in Alabasta until the situation stabilizes."

She glances your way briefly, then looks away.

> "That includes me."

A pause.

> "We'll be helping train palace guards, secure rebel strongholds, and remove any Baroque sleeper agents that may still be buried inside the civil structure."

Her tea is untouched again.

> "And we'll keep an eye on the Poneglyphs."

That last part is said softly, but not without weight.

---

### 💙 **Vivi**, looking much more like herself-radiant and relaxed in a way you *didn't* see during the war:

> "I'll be working closely with the Marine command. And the civilians. The rebels have started helping with rebuilding efforts now that the fighting's over, but..."

She sighs lightly.

> "There's a lot of hurt. That doesn't heal with just victory."

---

Cobra places a reassuring hand over hers.

She doesn't flinch.

But you see the **child beneath the crown**, if only for a moment.

---

Tashigi glances again-*at you this time*-and says, voice softer now:

> "It might help to have someone like you at the training grounds, you know."

> "Someone who understands more than tactics."

---

Cobra chimes in, still slicing his honeycake precisely:

> "I'm sure there's a need for a few civilian liaisons. Educational leaders. War has a habit of displacing teachers."

He looks at you, and this time, there's no amusement. Just... calm seriousness.

> "You said once you were afraid to get involved."

> "Now that you are... what will you do next?"

---

**All three look at you.**

No pressure.

Just curiosity.

And something else.

**Hope.**

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Answer them: you'll stay-help train, teach, rebuild.}
2. {Hedge-stay a little longer, but not commit fully yet.}
3. {Defer the answer, saying you want to help-but haven't decided what that means yet.}

---

You let their words settle.

Like sunlight warming stone.

Three people who've risked their lives and legacy now look to you-not for bravado, not for power, but for your *answer.*

And you give it.

Simple.

Unshaking.

---

> "I'll do whatever will help the most people."

Your tea is half-empty now.

Your voice is steady.

> "Put me wherever you need me."

---

There's a quiet, *real* pause.

A moment of shared breath and understanding.

It's not a grand proclamation.

You didn't punch the air, or summon a new elemental, or vow justice with flames behind your back.

You just said what needed saying.

And that?

**That hits harder than any heroic speech.**

---

**Vivi's lips part slightly**-not in surprise, but in something much more meaningful.

Admiration.

Not for your power.

But for your **conviction.**

---

**Tashigi lowers her gaze for a moment**, arms folding more comfortably than before.

She doesn't smile.

But there's a shift in how she sits.

She no longer faces you like a Marine assessing liability.

She's sitting beside a *comrade.*

---

**King Cobra nods once, deeply.**

> "A rare answer, Mr. Cheng."

> "And the right one."

He lifts his cup.

> "Then Alabasta accepts your service."

---

You clink your cup to his once more.

This time with *no performance.*

Just respect.

And shared purpose.

---

A servant leans into the room.

> "The Guard Academy representative is in the courtyard, Your Highness. Waiting for final instructor assessments."

Cobra gives the man a small wave of acknowledgment.

Then turns to you.

> "Would you like to sit in on some of the interviews?"

> "You'll meet the future captains. And maybe find where your voice will echo the loudest."

---

**Vivi nudges your shoulder with hers, softly.**

> "Breakfast first. Then you save the world again."

---

**OOC:**
You've taken your place. Not as a hero, but as something rarer:

**A man who stayed.**

Would you like to:

1. {Follow Cobra to the academy courtyard and meet the new recruits.}
2. {Take a quiet stroll with Vivi before the next duty begins.}
3. {Join Tashigi on a tour of the post-war security operations.}

>> USER: Option 2 / 3 - Promise to join Tashigi after I walk the food off. My stomach's still a little off due to my injuries.

I go for a stroll around the palace gardens. Never knew cactus could look so colorful.
