<pre>ing to be thick enough to work, though.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 2 Selected - "Kiwi Countermeasure, Lever Edition"**  
**Tone: Nervous Ingenuity | Mood: A Man About To Gamble His Citrus On Structural Engineering**  
**🎲 Juice Precision Roll - (Eatone +2 Devil Fruit Control, +1 Planning Under Pressure, -1 Thin Trajectory) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**🎲 Crocodile Awareness Roll - (+2 Observation, -2 Arrogant Monologue Mode) = Result: 0 [Mediocre]**  
**✅ Outcome: You manage to snake a juice tendril through the shadows and wrap the base of the lever-*soft, but sticky enough* to buy time when it matters. Crocodile doesn't notice... yet.**

---

You lower your voice to a whisper, barely audible over the soft echoes of Crocodile's speech below.

> "Maybe... maybe I can use my fruit.  
Kiwi juice-if you haven't smelled it already."

Tashigi exhales faintly through her nose.

> "I thought that was you."

> "Yeah. It's me.  
I can form a tendril. Not thick, but... maybe sticky enough to **jam the lever** if he pulls.  
No guarantees."

You kneel by the railing, shift your weight into your off-hand, and begin to focus.

---

Your palm pulses.

From your fingertips, a **fine green strand** snakes outward-thick as twine, slick as oil.  
It dips below the ledge, hugging the shadows, crawling along the **overhead beamwork** of the chamber.

You **guide it like a living thing**, steering each motion with micro-muscle control and instinct-juice flowing like **liquid intuition**.

Down.  
Left.  
Avoid the hanging chains.  
Avoid Crocodile's field of vision.

Your breath hitches as the tendril slips under the **lever's mechanism housing**, finally curling tight around the **release shaft** like a strand of seaweed gripping coral.

> **Connected.**

Not strong enough to stop a full-force pull-but **it'll slow the release**, maybe jam it if Crocodile does it with one hand.  
And more importantly?  
It gives you a **physical anchor point**. You now have tactile feedback on the lever.

If he moves it?

> **You'll feel it.**

---

**Crocodile remains oblivious.**  
Still puffing his cigar.  
Still pacing.  
Still talking about kings and fools and the weight of sand and destiny.

> "The people will cheer when I bring order to this rotting land.  
A hero. A savior. A name that lasts."

You and Tashigi remain crouched, invisible.  
The tendril glows faintly in your vision-*invisible to him*.

She leans in and whispers:

> "You just bought us our first piece of time.  
What's next?"

---

**📝 Update:**

- **Juice Tendril anchored to the lever** - sticky enough to delay, not stop.  
- You have **physical feedback** if Crocodile makes a move.  
- Crocodile is unaware of your presence.  
- Tashigi is waiting for your lead.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Send another juice thread to Vivi-time to let her know help is here. She might be able to signal.}  
2. {Start constructing a juice sling path to the cage-if you need to reach it fast, this is your prep.}  
3. {Prep to blind Crocodile with a flash of juice directly to his cigar-cut his vision first.}  
4. {Ask Tashigi to scout for a second entrance or sniper angle. You'll hold here.}  
5. {Wait. Keep observing. The trap is set. Let's see what he does next.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: ​Option X - Might as well try to juice up any other visible mechanisms. Observe Vivi

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option X Selected - "Operation: Juice the Room"**  
**Tone: Quiet Engineer | Action: Passive Juice Control + Observation**  
**🎲 Juice Utility Roll - (Eatone +2 Devil Fruit Mastery, +1 Subtle Control, +1 Engineering Intuition) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Stealth Check - Crocodile Awareness (+2 Perception, -2 Monologue Tunnel Vision) = Result: 0 [Mediocre]**  
**🎯 Outcome: You expand your tendril network subtly-no detection, and a little more influence over the room. Meanwhile, Vivi's body language gives you critical emotional data.**

---

You remain crouched, controlling your breath. Eyes focused, brain spinning like a tired teacher in a class full of spitballs and poor life choices.

> *Alright, Cheng. Time to juice the whole damn test.*

Your off-hand pulses again.

From the thread wrapped around the **lever**, you **split three more strands**-fine, trailing threads of kiwi juice, guided with microscopic precision. They stretch toward **visible mechanisms** on the platform:

- A **pulley brake** along the far right wall-*likely a failsafe*.  
- A **chain-lock wheel** connecting to the winch.  
- And a **trapdoor locking pin** built into the cage rig itself.

None of them are large enough to fully jam. But you're not trying to stop an engine-you're **gumming up the works**, adding just enough **stick and resistance** to make *everything slower, squeakier, and sloppier.*

Tashigi watches the lines weave with wide eyes.

> "It's like... citrus spider silk," she whispers.

> "Yeah," you whisper back. "With less murder.  
Usually."

---

Then, as you let your hand rest again-still connected by the thinnest of threads-you shift your gaze.

**To Vivi.**

You study her with a teacher's eye-like she's the one student who hasn't said a word all semester, but might snap under the pressure of finals week.

> She's shaking. Not in fear-**in control**.  
> Shoulders tight. Eyes alert.  
> Her hands, clenched around the bars, are **tapping-left, left, pause, right. Left, left, pause, right.**

> **A code? A pattern?** Could be nerves. Could be signal.  
> Her eyes are locked on Crocodile... but her posture says **she's planning.**

Then you notice something small but key:  
**Her foot shifts. Taps the base of the cage.** Once. Then again.

> A rhythm.

> *She's testing the floor.*

> She knows. She knows there's still time.  
She's **not giving up.**

And that means neither should you.

---

**📝 Status Update:**

- Juice tendrils now touching **four key points**: Lever, brake pulley, chain lock, trapdoor pin  
- Mechanisms are now **slightly jammed**, fully monitored by touch  
- Vivi appears **alert, active**, possibly planning or communicating in code  
- No detection. Crocodile remains arrogant and monologuing like it's his job

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Signal Vivi with a juice drop-tap back in the same rhythm. Let her know *someone* is listening.}  
2. {Tell Tashigi: "We've got time. I'm building a juice line to the cage. We may need to cross fast."}  
3. {Begin building pressure in the juice tendrils. If Crocodile activates anything, you can counter.}  
4. {Ask Tashigi if she knows **how** the drop trigger functions-can it be reversed? Can it be sabotaged?}  
5. {Whisper: "If he starts the drop... you go for the winch, I go for the hook. That cage doesn't fall." Finalize your emergency plan.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: ​Option X - I'm... I'm at a loss here. If he really commits to it, and if the cage mechanisms actually is an instant-drop, I'm not sure what to do. He could kill us in his sleep if we took him on. He's crocodile, after all.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option X Selected - "Crocodile. He could kill us in his sleep."**  
**Tone: Quiet Dread | Internal Monologue Spoken Aloud | Confession of Helplessness**  
**🎲 Resolve Maintenance Roll - (Eatone +1 Strategic Self-Doubt, +1 Realism, -1 Overwhelm Setting In) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**🎲 Tashigi's Leadership Roll - (+2 Empathy, +1 Steadfastness, +1 Personal Guilt About Smoker) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**✅ Outcome: You admit your fear-and Tashigi doesn't dismiss it. She steps into the leadership role *you're too honest to fake right now.*

---

You let out a quiet exhale-your hands are steady, but your soul isn't.

Your voice is soft, just above the sound of Crocodile's grandiose declarations below:

> "I'm... I'm at a loss here."

Tashigi doesn't move.

> "If he really goes for it-if the cage mechanisms are a true instant-drop...  
I don't know what to do. I can slow things down, but I can't stop physics.  
And if we take him on?"

You glance at her, eyes w</pre>
