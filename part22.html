<pre>, -1 Mild Exasperation) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**✅ Outcome: Tashigi is slightly amused and entirely honest. She gives you the full picture-*finally.***

---

You're halfway through adjusting the compression bandage when **her words hit you.**

> "...maybe catch a Warlord committing treason..."

You freeze.

Then-

> *Cough-coughCOUGH-SPIT*  
> "Wait-**WHOA WHOA WHOA-WHAT?!**"

You stagger back half a step, hand instinctively covering your chest like the **word "Warlord"** just punched you in the ribs.

> "*Warlord?!*  
I thought this was-what, **organized crime?** Black market arms? Casino laundering? Maybe *light child-snatching*?  
But *Warlord*?! What warlord?!"

Tashigi just stares at you.  
There's a beat of silence.

> "...You really didn't know."

> "NO, I DIDN'T KNOW! I came here for a **discount vacation**, not to get blasted by a guy with **government immunity and a sand motif!**"

She sighs. A long one. Then leans against the wall again.

> "Alright. You've earned it."

She looks at you-fully now. No Marine veneer.

> "**Sir Crocodile.**  
You know him from the newspapers. Hero of Alabasta. Pirate turned protector.  
Also-**Warlord of the Sea.** One of the Seven. Works ‘for' the World Government, but mostly does his own thing."

She pauses.

> "And he's the one running **Baroque Works.** Has been for years. Rain Dinners? This whole operation? It's a front."

> "A front... for *what?!*"

> "A coup."  
> "He's trying to topple the Alabasta monarchy and take control. That woman in blue you saw?  
If I'm right, that's **Princess Vivi.**"

You feel something between nausea and adrenaline start bubbling in your gut.

> "Oh good. Good.  
Warlord-helmed conspiracies, royal fugitives, secret death basements, and I've got a **fruit that makes juice.**"

Tashigi cracks a smile.

> "You're handling it better than most."

**📝 Major Lore Drop Gained:**

- **Sir Crocodile = Warlord of the Sea**
- **Baroque Works is his personal underground empire**
- The **woman in blue** is almost certainly **Princess Nefertari Vivi**
- Crocodile is attempting a **coup d'état in Alabasta**, using Rain Dinners as a key control point

You are now aware of **the real stakes**.

**Next Steps (while your rational brain catches up):**

1. {"Okay. I'm in. But I'm gonna complain the whole way." Continue down the tunnel with Tashigi, sarcastically.}
2. {"I need a plan." Stop and sketch a new plan with your juice. Something *smart*, now that you know the scale.}
3. {"This is above us. I'm calling Enzo anyway." Try again for outside reinforcements while Tashigi watches your back.}
4. {"Let's go find that princess." Focus the mission-get Vivi. She's the linchpin now.}
5. {"I want hazard pay." Mutter while you sneak ahead. Scout the flank path like you're not internally screaming.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: I... Shit... Egghh...

OOC: Tashigi notices my willingness to follow her wavering.

OOC: I left my den den mushi in my room, like a dumbass.

---

> "I... Shit... *Eggghh...*"

You lean a hand against the tunnel wall, the weight of what you just learned settling on your spine like a sack of test papers you forgot to grade and now they're *sentient*. Your knees don't buckle-but your will to keep walking *definitely does*.

Tashigi notices instantly.

Her steps slow. She doesn't draw her sword. Doesn't bark orders.  
She just... waits. Watches you. Then approaches-firm, but not forceful.

> "Hey."

She speaks like you're one of her cadets. Not beneath her. Not disposable.

> "You don't have to be a hero.  
You didn't sign up for this. Hell, I didn't sign up for this either."

You mutter something about forgetting your Den Den Mushi. Like a dumbass.  
She gives a crooked smile.

> "It happens. You'd be surprised how many Marines forget theirs during *training exercises,* never mind while chasing Warlords through casino basements."

Then, softer:

> "But you came this far. You saved my life. You called me ‘ma'am' like you meant it.  
That tells me everything I need to know."

She reaches into her coat. Pulls out a small rectangular badge-not a Marine insignia, but something smaller, older.

A **teacher's pin.**

> "Before the Marines, I worked a year in a community school on Shell Island.  
Thirty kids. Only two books. One chalk stick between them.  
I still think about them."

She holds it for a second longer... then tucks it away.

> "You came here to relax. And instead, you found out the world's uglier than you thought."  
> "But so did I. So does everyone-sooner or later."

She steps forward. Offers her hand.

> "You don't have to come any further if you don't want to. But if you do...  
I'd be proud to have you at my side."

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Take her hand. "Let's go before I change my mind." Continue on, shaken but loyal.}
2. {Take a minute. Sit, breathe, steady yourself, *then* go forward. No shame in needing 60 seconds.}
3. {Nod. "I'll follow... just not up front anymore." Support role only.}
4. {Decide to stay and guard the fallback point. Not cowardice-*contingency planning.*}
5. {Ask her one favor: "If I die, make sure the kids back home know I didn't just disappear."}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 2 - whew, give me a second to process my mortality.

I slap my face a few times, a few droplets of juice flung out by my still wet off-hand.

Alright. I suppose I couldn't let a nice lady like you get murdered by yourself. Not when I could've made a difference. 

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 2 Selected - "Give me a second to wrestle with the crushing awareness of my own fragile mortality."**

---

You raise a finger like you're about to pause class before a pop quiz.

> "*Whew.*"  
> "Just-just give me a second here to process my impending doom."

You drop to a seated crouch for a breath. Not slumped. Just... grounded.

You give yourself a firm slap on the cheeks-**not dramatic**, just enough to **jolt the cowardice off like dust from a coat**.

> *SPLAT.*  
A few **juice droplets fling off your left hand**, smacking the wall with soft *plips*, forming temporary little green comet-tails before fading.

You sigh.

Then rise.

> "Alright."  
> "I suppose I couldn't let a nice lady like you get murdered by yourself.  
Not when I could've made a difference."

Tashigi looks at you, blinking once-then nods slowly.

> "You're alright, Eatone."

Her hand doesn't move to her sword. It rests instead near her **Marine pin**, brushing it once like a grounding stone.

> "Let's go do something stupid and noble."
