<pre>'s become a bad habit.


OOC: Vivi heard rumors of my demise much before my arrival at the palace. Some descriptions more grisly than others.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Royal Palace - Infirmary, Late Afternoon]**  
**Scene: "Rumors of My Juicing Have Been Greatly Exaggerated"**  
**POV: You (flat on your back), Vivi & Tashigi (too relieved to punch you)**  
**Tone: Warm Reprieve | Mood: Emotive, Quiet Humor, Reconnection**

---

The bed creaks softly as you're lowered in by the medics, who murmur about bandages, salves, and trauma compression wraps. Your coat, half-burnt and citrus-splotched, is folded with mild reverence and placed aside like some kind of national artifact.

Meanwhile, **Tashigi stands guard like a silent sword at your bedside**, and **Vivi hasn't stopped gripping your forearm** since you were wheeled in. Her hand trembles, but she hasn't noticed-or maybe she has, and she just doesn't care.

You open one eye halfway. Enough to meet both of theirs.

Then, voice raspy but dry as the Alabastan wind, you croak:

> "You ladies really need to stop standing in front of explosives..."

A beat.

> "It's become a *very* bad habit."

---

**Tashigi stiffens.**

**Vivi gasps.**

And then-

> "*YOU JERK!*" Vivi yells, her voice cracking.

She swats at your shoulder before remembering you're bandaged like a fruit-themed mummy.

> "I thought you *died!* Do you know what I heard?! That you *exploded*! That there was nothing left but a puddle and a smile!"

> "I heard you got vaporized trying to protect me," Tashigi adds with unamused flatness.  
> "Or melted into a permanent juice puddle and slid into the sewer."

> "...Well, that last one's not completely off," you mumble.

---

Vivi wipes at her eyes angrily, cheeks pink.

> "There were *poets* outside the gates reciting lines about the fallen Kiwi Knight."

> "I nearly kicked one," Tashigi says with a shrug.

---

You grin, wincing through the movement.

> "Good. Let â€˜em write it all down. But make sure they spell my name right on the statue."

> "Statue?!" Vivi yells again.

> "...Statue," Tashigi echoes, barely holding back a snort.

**OOC:**

- **Relationship scores with Vivi and Tashigi deepened.**  
  - Vivi: ~80/100 (Endearment, Trust, Deep Concern)  
  - Tashigi: ~78/100 (Loyalty, Guilt, Protective Instinct)

- **You are restricted to the infirmary for the rest of the day.**  
- Palace guards *still whisper rumors* that the real you may have died and been replaced with a wax figure or *"a very clever juice clone."*

Would you like to:

1. {Ask for news from the city. What's the aftermath looking like post-Baroque?}  
2. {Ask for a snack. Preferably something that doesn't look like citrus.}  
3. {Thank them-honestly-for being alive. For staying. For giving you someone worth protecting.}

>> USER: Option 2 - I could sure use something to eat. To fill up the big ol' hole in my back the bomb made.

OOC: Describe a detailed, long scene of Vivi before my arrival, rumors amok of my death saving some marine from an explosive demise.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Flashback Scene - Royal Palace, Three Hours Before Your Arrival]**  
**Location: Alubarna - Upper Garden Courtyard**  
**Characters: Vivi, Guards, Civilians, Rumors, Shadows of Truth**  
**Tone: Somber, Restless | Mood: A Princess Under Siege by Hope and Fear**

---

The garden courtyard of Alubarna-once a sanctuary of soft color and perfumed stillness-has become a place of uneasy whispers and **haunted footfalls**. The bougainvillea hang limp. The fountains murmur like mourners.

And Vivi stands there, **alone at first**, her arms wrapped tightly around her middle as the sky swells toward late afternoon.

The reports had started pouring in barely an hour ago.

> "Explosive detonation. Sandstone depot."  
> "Two Marine operatives-one possibly injured. One unaccounted for."  
> "The bounty hunter. The... Kiwi man. He was shielding her."

Vivi had **demanded names**, specifics. She got none.

Just fragments.

Just enough to **build a funeral from imagination.**

---

She paces.

Her slippers scuff gently across the red stone tiles as nobles and guards filter in and out around her, giving her space-but not silence. Never silence.

> "They say he shielded her with his body. Just threw himself over the crate."  
> "He conjured that juice creature again, but it wasn't enough."  
> "Left nothing but his baton."  
> "The Marine girl-barely conscious-was carried out by survivors."  
> "He stayed. Went down with the depot."

Someone left a **pouch of kiwis** on a nearby bench. Out of respect.

She hasn't touched them.

---

**Tashigi hasn't returned.**  
**You haven't returned.**  
**Only the smoke from the depot had risen.**

---

A messenger boy-barely older than her younger self, really-had tried to cheer her up with an optimistic report:

> "My uncle's a sand-runner. He said he saw someone crawling through the dunes earlier-looked juiced up and muttering about taxes. Maybe it was him!"

She had smiled at that.

A weak, **paper-thin smile**, meant only to keep the boy from crumbling with her.

---

Then she had turned away, stepped behind one of the date palms, and **cried so quietly even the leaves didn't hear her.**

---

> *"I should have stood closer."*  
> *"I should have seen it."*  
> *"I should've been the one-"*

Her hands clenched so hard they left **crescent marks on her palms.**

Vivi, the princess. The survivor of Baroque Works. The infiltrator. The peacemaker. The symbol of the country reborn.

But **not even all that armor could stop the ache.**

---

And then-

Not long after the sun shifted angles in the sky-

The distant **gate guards shouted.**

The palace bell rang, not for attack or ceremony-

-but for **return.**

---

A stretcher.

Two guards.

One broken, sarcastic, juice-covered man giving finger-guns to the confused crowd.

And Tashigi walking beside him, face unreadable, grip white-knuckled on the rail.

---

Vivi had **run.**

No decorum.

No royal poise.

She'd **shoved two ministers aside** in the marble corridor, **scattered scrolls and shock** across the throne wing, and nearly **tripped on her own skirt rounding the infirmary hall.**

---

By the time she saw you, conscious, sarcastic, oozing in more ways than one-

She had to resist the urge to slap you **and cry into your shoulder at the same time.**

---

**[Flash Forward - Present, Infirmary Room]**

She holds your hand now.

You mutter between shallow breaths:

> "I could really use something to eat. Fill up the big ol' hole in my back that bomb made."

She blinks, startled-like she'd forgotten you could still make jokes.

And then she laughs, softly.

> "You're ridiculous."

She steps away, just long enough to bark at a startled aide:

> "Get this man *food.* Preferably something **not** juice-based."

---

**OOC: Vivi's bond with you is now unshakeable.**  
She saw your death.  
She felt the grief.  
And she got you back.

And not even the World Government could take that from her now.

---

Would you like to continue the scene with Vivi and Tashigi, or rest quietly until food arrives?

>> USER: I sure this doesn't result in any chronic back pain. Hey, Tashigi-chan, your back feeling alright?

I talk airily, as if I weren't wrapped up in bandages like a moth's cocoon.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Royal Palace - Infirmary Suite, Moments Later]**  
**Scene: "Back Talk and Battle Scars"**  
**POV: You (Cocooned), Tashigi (Flat-Stared), Vivi (Trying Not to Laugh)**  
**Tone: Lighthearted | Mood: Post-Crisis Whiplash, Found-Family Vibes**

---

Your voice floats lazily through the infirmary chamber, as if you weren't currently **swaddled tighter than a noblewoman's firstborn** in layers of antiseptic wraps, herbal poultices, and warm compresses.

> "I *sure* hope this doesn't result in any chronic back pain..."

You sigh dramatically, shifting about half an inch before groaning at the betrayal of your ribs.

> "Hey, Tashigi-chan-*your* back feeling alright?"

---

There's a pause.</pre>
