<pre> the moment completely. You become *Rain Dinners legend*. You buy time, build clout, and steer attention away from Vivi's corridor.**

---

You give a soft chuckle at the pit boss's "management" offer, shaking your head like you just got asked to headline the Grand Line's Got Talent tour.

> "Hah! Management? You flatter me, sir-  
No, I'm just a humble schoolteacher."

The pit boss raises a brow. You continue, letting your tone shift into something gentle, proud.

> "I enjoy inspiring kids, you know?"

You lift your glass, glancing around the crowd. The gamblers, the servers, the thrill-chasers and deadbeat drifters-some barely older than your students, others emotionally stunted by years of betting slips and lost dreams.

> "In a way... these are kids too."

And then-**you step onto the raised lip of the Banana Gator tank**, glass held high.

> "TO SNACK PACK!" you bellow, voice cutting through the air like a shining blade of citrus truth.  
> "May his scales always shimmer, and his snack game always stay *juiced!*"

The room erupts.

**Daiquiris fly. Toasts are shouted. Gator tails slap the water in violent agreement. Someone throws confetti. Snack Pack lets out a triumphant grunt and slaps his flipper to the tank wall in perfect synch with your raised glass.**

The pit boss just laughs and takes a long drink of Mizu Gold '27.

> "You're something else, Mr. Cheng."

---

**RESULT:**
- You've bought **time**. **Attention is off you**, off the staff corridor, and fixed on your glorious, gator-loving self.
- The **guard at the staff corridor** relaxes slightly. Less tense. Less alert.
- The **pit boss** is now emotionally invested in your narrative. He won't act against you unless absolutely necessary.
- You've secured your role as **casino royalty**-a local legend, a mysterious teacher, a high-rolling gambler who drinks like a noble and bets like a fool.

---

**Your options are now even wider than before. What you do next may determine how deeply you get involved in Vivi's fate... or Crocodile's downfall.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {While the crowd celebrates, slip into the staff corridor after Vivi. No one will notice now.}
2. {Keep playing the high roller-start asking about "rare guests," "closed corridors," or anything involving the royal family.}
3. {Excuse yourself quietly and send a message to Smoker via Kiwi Juice. "Something's going down. Woman in blue."}
4. {Find a quiet spot to follow Vivi's trail more subtly-perhaps even use your fruit to sense water trail residue.}
5. {Invite the pit boss to a drink in your suite. See what kind of dirt he spills behind closed doors.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 3 - excuse myself, say I need to use the gentlemen's room. Look for Smoker (or maybe bump into Tashigi)

OOC: I know of Smoker from the news, but not Tashigi.

>> ASSISTANT: **ðŸŽ² Option 3 Selected - "Excuse me, nature calls... also, time to find a chain-smoking Marine."**  
**ðŸŽ­ Tone: Polite Disengagement + Covert Intent | Status: VIP Free Roaming Access**  
**ðŸŽ² Social Disengage Roll - (Eatone +2 Rapport, +1 Party Credit, +1 Pit Boss Favor) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ðŸŽ² Search Roll - (Eatone +1 Careful, +1 Knowledge of Smoker's Habits, +1 Devil Fruit Juice Sense) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**ðŸŽ¯ Outcome: You disengage smoothly and head toward the aquarium corridors. You do not find Smoker... but you *do* find Tashigi.**

---

You clink your glass with the pit boss one last time and offer a perfectly-timed, totally-believable out:

> "Excuse me, sir-must make a quick stop at the gentlemen's room. All these daiquiris, you know."

He chuckles, gestures lazily with his glass.

> "Don't fall in. And tell Snack Pack I said hi."

You slip through the crowd like a sand eel, nodding at smiling patrons as you meander toward the **aquarium wing**-where you first glimpsed Smoker earlier. You pass the regular restrooms, but your focus isn't on porcelain thrones.

It's on **finding the Marine ghost watching this place from the shadows.**

---

### ðŸ§ƒ Kiwi Juice Sense Activated - Micro-moisture Tracking  
- You let a light mist of your Devil Fruit's juice trail around your collarbone and earlobes-*tuned for tobacco tang and high body heat.*
- You catch a faint, lingering humidity signature... then something fresher: **polished metal**, **warm footsteps**, **sword oil**.

You round a corner into a **dim corridor behind the aquarium's service tanks**, where the neon lights fade into cold blue, and tourists aren't allowed.

And there-**you nearly collide with her**.

---

### **You have encountered: Tashigi**  
- **Marine Lieutenant (Junior Grade)**  
- Wearing a brown officer's coat and sword strapped at her hip.  
- Glasses slightly askew.  
- Currently holding a **Den Den Mushi in one hand**, pacing, whispering-unaware of you until the very last moment.

She spins as you round the corner, instantly dropping into a **low-ready combat stance**, sword half-drawn.

> "Stay back!" she snaps.  
> "This hallway is off-limits-show me your identification! Who are you?!"

---

**OOC Notes:**
- Your character **does not know her by name**, only recognizes **the Marine insignia and swordsmanship posture**.
- She is **not currently aggressive**, just defensive-caught off guard mid-investigation.
- You still have your **"Cheng, VIP Room 703" identity** if you want to play dumb-or come clean.

---

**What do you do?**

1. {"Whoa, whoa-VIP guest! Cheng. I got turned around looking for the bathroom. Honest mistake." Keep cover.}
2. {"I'm Eatone. I'm a teacher and freelance bounty hunter. I know who your boss is. I think we're on the same side here." Break cover.}
3. {Use your Devil Fruit to send a juice-thread message around the corner: "Straw Hats. Vivi. East corridor. Rain Dinners trap."}
4. {Play confused, stall, and see if she'll slip intel. "What's going on here, anyway?"}
5. {Backpedal fast and vanish. You didn't get caught. Don't blow your position yet.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: â€‹Option 1 - Whoa, holy shit, lady! Easy on the sword! Back off, Nearly spill my drink in the process. 

>> ASSISTANT: **ðŸŽ² Option 1 Selected - "Whoa! Holy shit, lady!"**  
**ðŸŽ­ Tone: Alarmed Tourist + Clumsy VIP | Cover Identity: Fully Maintained (Cheng, Room 703)**  
**ðŸŽ² Bluff Roll - (Eatone +2 Performance, +1 Plausible Distraction, +1 Drink As Prop) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**ðŸŽ² Tashigi's Suspicion Roll - (+2 Protocol, -2 Flustered) = Result: 0 [Mediocre]**  
**âœ… Outcome: SUCCESS - Tashigi stands down, realizes you're not a threat, and apologizes while staying wary.**

---

You throw your free hand up as you **stumble back dramatically**, daiquiri sloshing in your grip like a tiny tidal wave of alcohol-based innocence.

> "**Whoa-holy shit, lady!** Easy on the sword!"  
> "I'm just-*I'm just trying to find the bathroom!*"

You **nearly spill the Mizu Gold**, managing to save it only by **tilting your wrist at the last second** like a seasoned juice handler.

The blue light glints off your glass. You widen your eyes. Throw in a little breathy panic. The full package.

Tashigi freezes.

> "I-oh."  
> "I thought-dammit."  
> She pushes her glasses up, cheeks coloring with embarrassment.

> "Sorry. Sorry. You're-one of the VIPs?"

> "Room 703," you mutter, shaking your head, "and I am **not** paid enough to get impaled in the dark by a Marine. I teach kids. I'm on vacation. I drink daiquiris and bet on gators."

She lowers the sword, still frowning, but clearly rattled.

> "Right. Sorry again. We've had... security issues. There's been movement through the staff corridors, unauthorized agents, and possibly infiltrated personnel. I thought you were-"

She stops herself. You see her mentally slam the brakes.

> "Never mind. It's classified."

---

She steps aside, eyes still flicking toward her Den Den Mushi as it hums silently in standby.

You notice her coat isn't fully buttoned. There's a **Marine logbook** half-tucked into her pocket, and the hilt of her sword is </pre>
