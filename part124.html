<pre>*OOC: PAUSED.**  
(When ready, we will continue with a timed threat event: ticking time bomb. Lives on the line.  
React quickly. Narrate or act. Every moment counts.)

>> USER: In one movement, pure instinct, I run over and wrap my arms around Tashigi's waist, then spin her around, facing away from the crate. I will Kiwi Kop to get behind me and attempt to smother the crate. Before I can offer an explanation to her flustered/embarrassd squawk, or push her away, the drowned crate detonates.

Not as catastrophically as it could've been (otherwise we'd all have become sketchy kebab meat), but it's still big. Heavy injuries expected.

The shockwave slams into me from behind.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandstone Depot - Emergency Event: Explosive Detonation]**  
**Scene: "Human Shield, Fruit Armor"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Sacrificial | Mood: Violent, Valiant, Unforgiving Consequence**

---

The **moment stretches.**

A heartbeat becomes an **eternity**.

Your feet are already moving before your mind finishes the thought.

> *Tashigi's too close.*  
> *There's no time to yell.*  
> *There's only time to act.*

---

**You're at her side in one breath.**

Your arms lock around her waist-**not with finesse, but with ferocity.**

She lets out a startled, indignant gasp:

> "Wh-!?"

But there's no time.

You **pivot**, slam your boots into the dirt, and **twist her away from the crate** just as a tremor runs through the floorboards like the bones of a dying beast.

---

> "Kiwi Kop! *NOW!*"

The elemental answers with a **guttural roar**, flinging itself over the nearest crate like a sloshing shield wall-its limbs stretching into **a great dome of syrupy resistance**.

Too little time.  
Too much explosive.

---

**BOOM.**

The **crate erupts.**

A flood of sand, shrapnel, and smoke **slams into your back like a giant's hammer.**  
**Kiwi Kop absorbs the brunt of it**-but even his saturated body **ripples and shatters**, shards of juice flinging outward like flecks of acid rain.

**You bear the rest.**

---

**CONSEQUENCES:**

- Shockwave Damage: (2d10+5) → **9 + 7 + 5 = 21**  
- Mitigation from Kiwi Kop: **-8**  
- Mitigation from Gear: **-3**  
- Final Impact: **10 HP direct trauma + blast concussion**

**Result: Brutally injured. Cracked ribs. Burned shoulder. Temporarily deaf in one ear.**

---

You hit the ground hard, **Tashigi tumbling on top of you**, shielded from the brunt of the explosion. Her arms scramble around you the moment the world stops spinning.

> "EATONE?!"

Her voice is muffled-**everything's muffled.** Like you're underwater, brain still vibrating inside your skull.

---

Your cloak is half burned.

Your badge is dented.

Your back feels like it's trying to **separate from your spine**.

And still-

You're breathing.

She is, too.

---

The guards scramble. One's yelling. The other's coughing through smoke.

You see a **giant streak of emerald juice** slowly pooling under what's left of Kiwi Kop-splattered against the far wall, **broken but loyal to the last drop.**

---

Tashigi's face hovers over yours-smeared with ash, eyes blazing.

> "Why would you-? What the hell were you thinking?!"

Your hearing's still not fully back.

Your heartbeat's too loud.

But you manage a rasp.

> "Instinct."

Then a faint smile.

> "...Tactical morale reset."

---

**OOC: You're alive. Kiwi Kop is out of commission. Tashigi is safe.**

But something *more sinister* is now confirmed:

**Baroque Works left sleeper explosives wired to *timed detonation orders*, not remote signals. Meaning others may be active elsewhere.**

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Wave off help, try to stand. Let her yell while you focus on the mission.}  
2. {Let her yell. You're not getting up anytime soon. Take the scolding. You earned it.}  
3. {Ask someone to check the map. "402 NW of Alubarna." You have a sinking feeling.}

>> USER: ​Option 2 - it feels like Mr. 4 and his stupid cannonballs all over again. I groan, unable to get up. Look Tashigi up and down for any injuries 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandstone Depot - Aftermath, Scorched Ground]**  
**Scene: "Bruised, Broken, Breathing"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Exhausted | Mood: Gut-Punched Gravity, Fierce Concern**

---

You lie on the floor like a man who just got used as a **fruit-based meat shield**, because, well... **you were.**

Your back screams.

Your legs don't want to work.

Your ears are ringing.

Your ribs feel like they're holding a personal grudge.

And for a flicker of a second-just a second-you swear you can still hear **Snack Pack's battle cry** in the recesses of your memory.

---

> "Uuugh... not again..." you mutter with a dry wheeze.  
> "Feels like Mr. 4's stupid cannonballs all over again."

You **groan**-not out of pain this time, but out of sheer exhausted *offense.*

---

You **tilt your head** weakly toward Tashigi, eyes scanning her.

She's ash-dusted, her coat torn along one shoulder, and her hair's half-fallen from its clip. But she's upright. Breathing. Not bleeding. And most importantly-

**Still whole.**

---

Her hands are on you-**checking your pulse**, fumbling for wounds-her movements jerky, wild with adrenaline. Then she sees your eyes locked on hers.

> "You-You absolute *idiot.*"

> "Valid."

> "You threw yourself on me like some *dramatized ballad hero!* Do you think that makes you noble?! That could've-You almost-!"

Her hands clench into fists on your collar. Her jaw trembles.

But her eyes don't leave yours.

> "You didn't have to."

You manage a pained smile.

> "Actually... I kinda did."

---

She stares a beat longer.

Then-

**gently**-lets your collar go.

And stays right beside you, knees in the dirt, her blade laid across her lap like an extension of her body.

---

**Behind her, the guards are shouting for a medic.**  
Someone's dragging the remaining agent up from where Kiwi Kop pinned him.  
The other starts poking the blackened crates cautiously with the **blunt end of his spear**.

---

> "Check every seal," Tashigi calls without turning.  
> "These weren't mines. They were *warnings.*"

Then to you, softer:

> "You see a bomb again, pineapple? **Shout first.** Dramatically throw yourself into harm *second.*"

You groan again.

> "Noted."

---

**OOC: Severe wound sustained. You're currently in the "crippled" state-limited combat ability until healed.**

**Tashigi: unharmed physically. Emotionally? Rattled. Deepened bond. Respect laced with anger and fear for your safety.**

---

Would you like to:

1. {Ask to be carried back to town with full dramatic flair. Make it awkward.}  
2. {Insist on staying for the evidence sweep. Let Tashigi scold you more while you lie there.}  
3. {Mention the "402 NW" code quietly, while you're down-let her investigate it further.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - Ohhhhhhh I'm going to need more of that palace healthcare again. I hope they don't bill me this time.

And don't tell me that I shouldn't have shielded you. You could've died. 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandstone Depot - Emergency Evac, Post-Incident]**  
**Scene: "Heroic Mush, Part II"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Pained Humor | Mood: Protective Instinct, Emotional Tension, Slow Exit**

---

You lie there like a man who just went five rounds with a sandstorm and lost a fight to a crate.

With a **raspy wheeze**, you raise one shaky arm toward the sky like a tragic theater actor, your other hand resting over your ribs like you're auditioning for a particularly *dramatic* play called *"Oh No, My Spine."*

> "Oooooohhhh... I'm gonna need more of that **palace healthcare** again. And this time... I really hope they don't bill me."

Tashigi exhales hard, fighting the smirk trying to tug at the corner of her mouth.

---

She crouches back down, her gloved hand gently nudging your cheek to keep your head elevated while one of the guards approaches with a **folding stretcher**.

> "You're a mess."

> "Correction: I am a *heroic* mess."

You look up at her with all the composure of someone who just got thrown by the </pre>
