You don't speak.

There's nothing clever left to say.  
No quip. No retort.  
No lecture on the responsibilities of adults or the failures of nations.

Just-

> *A nod.*

Heavy. Slow.  
Full of everything you couldn't put into words if you tried.

---

**Tashigi watches you.**

For a moment, her features soften-just slightly.  
Like the soldier's mask she wears cracks enough for the woman beneath to see you not as a colleague, or a fool...

But as a man who stood up until he couldn't.

---

She exhales, the sound like steel cooling.

> "Stay alive, Sensei."

Then she turns, sword drawn once more, stepping toward the alley's edge-  
where the plaza begins to burn louder.

---

And you lean back, head against the stone, letting the war echo just beyond your reach.

You're still in this fight.

Even if it's just to keep breathing until the kids win.

---

**OOC:**  
You are now in a **temporary disabled state**.  
- Unable to walk unaided.  
- Juice at critical low.  
- Still conscious.  
- **Tashigi** is clearing the path ahead for your return to the narrative climax.

You've held the line.

Now it's their turn.

Would you like to fade to black briefly, or continue observing from the ground, waiting to re-enter when the timing's right?

>> USER: I shift into an alleyway, hopefully out of sight of passerbys.

OOC: Meanwhile... At the plaza

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Plaza of Sand and Smoke]**  
**Scene: "The Rally Point"**  
**Tone: Tense | Mood: Truth Teetering on a Razor's Edge**

---

**Location: Clocktower Plaza, First District**  
The sun is a molten coin in the sky, framed by rising pillars of smoke. The **plaza**-once a grand communal square for festivals and royal proclamations-is now a cracked battlefield-in-waiting.

**Thousands** of **rebel soldiers** crowd the stone thoroughfare, banners raised, weapons drawn, sand crusting their boots. Their faces are twisted with **anger**, **confusion**, and **loss**.

And at the center-  
Standing on a makeshift dais made of a shattered cart and broken stone-

**Kohza.**

The rebel leader.  
Vivi's childhood friend.  
His voice is raised, rallying the army to charge the **royal palace**, convinced King Cobra has betrayed the people.

---

> "We've waited long enough! They stole the rains! They stole our food! Now they'll pay in blood-!"

His words whip the crowd into a frenzy.

The pressure is rising.

If no one stops it-  
This war will ignite *for real*.

---

But just before the final shout-  
**a figure bursts onto the plaza from the side streets.**

---

**Vivi.**

Covered in dust. Eyes blazing.

**Luffy, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, Chopper** at her back.

She raises her hands.

Her voice *cuts* through the chaos like a blade:

> "*STOP!!*"

---

The crowd goes still.

Weapons lower-but not entirely.

Kohza turns, disbelief and tension carved into every line of his face.

> "...Vivi?"

---

She walks forward, slowly.

> "It wasn't the king. It wasn't the royal family."

> "The drought... the uprising... everything. *All of it.*"

Her voice trembles, but doesn't break.

> "It was Baroque Works. It was **Crocodile**."

---

Murmurs erupt.

Confused. Angry. Skeptical.

> "Liar."  
> "Is that really her?"  
> "Crocodile's a hero."  
> "What proof does she have?"

---

Vivi stands tall.

Her fists tighten at her sides.

> "You want proof? Look at your men. Look at the â€˜royal guards' that ambushed you. Look at the agents hiding in *your own army!*"

> "How many of them refused to recognize me?!"

---

Kohza's expression begins to change.

He looks toward the surrounding soldiers-many of whom **aren't reacting** the way they should.

---

And that's when it happens.

**Gunfire.**

From the **rooftops.**

A sudden scream. A *planted* explosion.

A shot fired from within the rebel ranks-

And someone cries:

> "THE ROYAL GUARD HAS FIRED FIRST!"

The trap is sprung.

---

**Panic.**

The rebels begin to charge.  
The plaza explodes into **chaos**.

And through it all, Vivi stands still-frozen, **betrayed again**, her voice drowned beneath the fury of manipulated war.

---

**Luffy turns to her.**  
His expression hardens.

> "We're not done yet."

---

**OOC: The plaza is now in full combat.  
Baroque agents have triggered a false-flag operation to reignite the war.  
Vivi's words *almost* worked-but Crocodile's hand was faster.**

Would you like to cut back to Eatone attempting to re-enter the scene-or continue following the Straw Hats' intervention at the heart of the uprising?

>> USER: Continue with the intervention. 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Fire Beneath the Sand]**  
**Scene: "Intervention at the Breaking Point"**  
**Tone: Urgent | Mood: Courage vs. Chaos**

---

**The false gunshot echoes like a match dropped on dry grass.**

In seconds, the carefully balanced moment **collapses**.  
The rebel line surges. The royal forces-drawn from the palace's interior-rally in a panic.  
The **plaza erupts** into a brawl of steel, smoke, and screams.

**But the Straw Hats don't hesitate.**

---

> **Luffy**, face set with uncharacteristic focus, leaps up the side of a plaza building in seconds. His body arcs through the air like a coiled spring unleashed.

> "I'll stop the gunfire!"

You see it-**snipers** on the roofs. Hidden Baroque Works agents using both sides as puppets.

Luffy **stretches**, his arms launching outward-

> *"Gomu Gomu no Gatling!"*

-*and flattens three rooftop agents* in a blur of fists and motion.

---

> **Sanji** dives into the chaos, spinning through royal guards and rebels alike-not to injure, but to **disarm**, knock back, and *redirect*.

> "Out of the way, you amateurs! You're all being played!"

---

> **Usopp** raises his slingshot high, firing a **Firebird Star** into the air-a bright streak of light arcing above the battlefield.

> "HEY! LISTEN UP! This war's fake! You're being played like chumps by Crocodile!"

Some hear him. Some don't.

---

> **Nami** grabs **Chopper's** hoof and yells into the winds rising off the desert.

> "You've got one job: keep Vivi safe! I'll start calling down lightning if this gets any worse."

She raises her **Clima-Tact**, winds whipping around her as she begins to form **storm clouds** in the heat-choked air.

---

**Vivi... stands still.**

Her eyes wide, watching everything **she tried to prevent unfold again**.

Until **Chopper** tugs her arm.

> "Vivi! We still have a chance!"

---

She snaps back into motion.

> "Kohza!"

She darts toward the platform, trying to reach him again-but the tide of soldiers is **pushing them apart**.

---

**Kohza**, still trying to restore order, is losing his grip on the moment.

> "STOP FIGHTING! I SAID-*STOP!!*"

But it's a maelstrom.

---

**Then, overhead-**

> *A familiar laugh.*  
> *Dry. Smug. Echoing.*

> **"I was wondering when you'd all show up."**

**Crocodile's voice.**

---

Every head turns toward the **palace roofline** where **he now stands**, cloak billowing, beside a restrained, slumped figure-

**King Cobra.**

---

> "Nice of you to make it just in time to witness the fall of a kingdom."

His voice carries.

> "Don't worry. I'm not here to kill you."

> "I'm here to show you that no matter how much you fight..."

He gestures broadly to the plaza below.

> "You're *already too late.*"

---

**OOC: Crocodile is now visible.  
King Cobra is his hostage.  
He is openly taunting the crowd, destabilizing all efforts to end the conflict peacefully.**

Vivi, Luffy, and the crew are trying to keep things from spiraling completely out of control.

Would you like to:  
1. {Continue following the Straw Hats' fight to stabilize the plaza.}  
2. {Shift perspective to Crocodile's taunt and Cobra's condition.}  
3. {Begin transitioning back to Eatone and Tashigi's POV.}
