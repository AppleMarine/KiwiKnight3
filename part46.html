<pre>ou step a little closer to her.

> "Stay tight, Blue."

She nods. Not afraid.  
Focused.

---

Bon Clay, eyes cleared now, snarls with dignity.

> "**HOW RUDE.**  
Is it so hard to offer a man a little *dramatic stage time* before he's blasted again?!"

He pulls one hand to his face-  
And suddenly, with a *wet slap*, **his features change.**

**Clone-Clone Fruit activated.**

In a moment, he looks **exactly like Tashigi.**

> "Let's see how YOU like beating up a sweet young Marine girl!"

---

**OOC Alert:**

Bon Clay is now using the powers of the **Mane Mane no Mi (Clone-Clone Fruit).**  
He can copy any person he touches-**voice, body, face, everything.**  
He's copied Tashigi.

Vivi, behind you, gasps-but doesn't move.

> "That's not her," she says. "She's still there-left side. But... gods, it's uncanny."

---

**You are up. He's still stuck, but preparing something.  
You've stepped closer to Vivi. No allies are coming. Not yet.**

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Taunt him: "I've hit Tashigi before. Didn't stop her. Won't stop me." Slam him again.}  
2. {Try to manipulate juice into his mouth/nose-drown his clone disguise with golden gunk.}  
3. {Ask Vivi quietly: "You ever sparred a fake Marine before?" Prepare to fight together.}  
4. {Try to stall. Talk him down. Maybe he likes monologues. You can bait him longer.}  
5. {Use the juice mist to try and **mark the real Tashigi** subtly-keep track of fakes.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 5 - his body may have entirely changed, but the misting pattern on his clothes is different. It won't work on me, probably.

Also.. I grimace. Does it clone things... Down there?

I quickly turn back to Vivi. Please don't listen to this, blue.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - Identity Crisis and Unwanted Imagery]**  
**Tone: Hyper-Aware | Mood: Tactical Focus, Inappropriate Thoughts at High Speed**  
**ðŸŽ¯ Result: You maintain full awareness of Bon Clay despite the disguise. Your mist-subtle, tactile, and already in place-**betrays the truth his appearance tries to hide.**  
Also, you accidentally traumatize Vivi for approximately 1.3 seconds.**

---

Bon Clay-now **Tashigi-shaped**-poses dramatically, one hand on a hip he didn't earn, lips pursed into a smug, perfect pout.

> "*Now you face a true moral dilemma, pineapple man! Will you strike a lady? Can you best the elegant blade of Justice?!*"

You don't blink.

You don't buy it.

Because your **mist** is still curling along his body, dancing around his ankles, clinging slightly to the creases in his coat.

> *Different folds.*  
> *Different gait.*  
> *Wrong damn center of balance.*

---

> *Nice try.*

You shift your grip subtly on the baton-eyes scanning not just the shape but the **resistance** of your vapor.  
Clone or not, he **can't hide the texture.** The mist remembers more than a face.

You open your mouth to speak-  
Then blink.

Frown.

> "Wait-does that thing clone, uh... *everything?*"

Your eyes widen in quiet panic.  
You grimace.

> *Oh no.*

You glance over your shoulder at Vivi with dawning horror.

> "Please don't listen to this, Blue."

She, of course, *was* listening.  
And now she's frozen, mid-blink, clearly caught between **diplomatic detachment** and **psychological damage**.

> "...I will try not to imagine it."

---

Bon Clay/Tashigi gasps with exaggerated insult.

> "*Are you suggesting I would sully the sanctity of a lady's form with uncouth mimicry?!*  
*I am an artist, not a deviant!*"

Then he immediately **winks**.

> "But yes."

---

Vivi quietly whispers, **"I'm never unhearing that."**

---

**OOC Update:**

- Your mist field has proven to be a **countermeasure against visual deception.**  
- You are now aware that while Bon Clay can mimic physical appearances, he **cannot replicate internal sensory interactions.**  
- Your ability to **sense the real person through your mist** is now a **passive bonus** in fights against transformation-based foes.

---

**Bon Clay is preparing to break free of the stickiness.  
The clone form has bought him time.  
Vivi is trying not to look at either of you.**

---

**What's your next move?**

1. {Strike now. Baton to the gut. He's still stuck and distracted.}  
2. {Cover him in golden juice again. Thicker. Don't let him move a damn inch.}  
3. {Let Vivi strike. "Your call, princess. Wanna end him?"}  
4. {Blind him again. Sour burst to the face. Turn that wink into a squint.}  
5. {Try to coordinate with Tashigi-have her flank while you keep him talking.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 2 - I prepare another golden orb for launch.

OOC: Meanwhile Tashigi notices herself, albeit with weird poses and expressions.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - Juicy Justice: Round Three]**  
**Tone: Controlled Precision | Mood: Tactical Humiliation, Synchronized Smackdown**  
**ðŸŽ² Golden Juice Launch - (Eatone +2 Fruit Control, +1 Focused Emotion, +1 Visual Targeting) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**ðŸŽ¯ Outcome: Bon Clay is slammed with a second wave of **hyper-adhesive golden kiwi concentrate**, further locking down his limbs. Now both legs and one arm are glued to the ground. He is, in every sense, stuck being *extra*.**

---

You ignore the insults.  
The wink.  
The nightmarish philosophical implications of whether Devil Fruit cloning extends to...

> *You know what? No.*

You inhale, square your stance, and call it again.

> *Golden kiwi. Thick. Sticky. Shut-him-up consistency.*

Your palm pulses once-  
And a bright **golden orb** begins to swell and shimmer in your hand.  
Richer this time. **Heavier. Thicker.**  
Like caramelized citrus ready to be *weaponized.*

---

Bon Clay-as-Tashigi raises a fan in his free hand, still stuck mid-kick, striking a ridiculous pose as if *this was all part of the choreography.*

> "*Do your worst, fruit boy! I have suffered worse than this in the fires of interpretive dance!*"

You don't answer.  
You just **let fly**.

> *FWMP.*

The orb slams into his **upper chest**, immediately spreading into a *bright yellow goo web* that splashes across his arm, neck, and one side of his face.

He shrieks.

> "*MY EXTENSION RANGE! YOU MONSTER-MY LIMBS!*"

---

Meanwhile, off to the side-

**Tashigi**, mid-slash against a scimitar-wielding agent, happens to glance toward the riverbank.

She **freezes for just a half-second**.

Because **there she is.**  
Or... someone that looks **exactly** like her.  
Flailing. Screaming.  
Mouth glued halfway open.

And **posing** like a drunken runway model.

She blinks.  
> "...The hell is-"

Then sees **you** standing above the imitation with juice dripping from your outstretched hand.

Her eye twitches.

> "That *bastard's using my face.*"

She **growls**, parries her attacker, and starts heading your way-**intent on reclaiming her dignity.**

---

**OOC Update:**

- Bon Clay is now **fully immobilized**-both legs and an arm **pinned to the ground** with golden kiwi glue.  
- He can still talk, but any action he takes will take a full round to break through.  
- **Tashigi** has noticed the clone and is now en route, adding extra danger to Bon Clay's day.  
- Your golden juice continues to evolve, reacting to your tactical needs.

---

**Vivi steps beside you, eyes narrowed.**

> "You're getting better at that."

You shrug modestly.

> "Practice makes... pulp."

She groans quietly.

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Leave Bon Clay stuck-move to assist Tashigi or Zoro. You've done enough here.}  
2. {Coordinate with Tashigi-she deserves a swing. "Hey Marine, wanna punch your own face?"}  
3. {Keep a watchful eye on Bon Clay. He's slippery. Literally. You're not falling for a clone feint.}  
4. {Talk to Vivi-ask her how close Alubarna is, or what the next move is after this ambush.}  
5. {Taste the new juice. Does it have *flavor properties* too? You're in it now. Might as well understand.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option X - Maintain protective vigil over Vivi. See if anyone needs help, though.
