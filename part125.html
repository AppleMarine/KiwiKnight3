<pre>plot-and *landed in friendship*.

> "And don't even try to tell me I shouldn't have shielded you."  
> "You could've *died*, Tashigi."

She opens her mouth.

Closes it again.

---

A flicker of frustration crosses her face-but it's not **anger**.  
Not really.

It's guilt. It's fear.  
And maybe-just maybe-it's something even heavier.

> "And if *you* died, then what, huh?" she mutters.  
> "Do you know what that would've done to Vivi? To me?"

Your grin falters just slightly.

Then you speak, quieter this time.

> "But you *didn't* die."

> "You lived. That's... all I needed to make peace with it."

---

The guard snorts as he finishes unfolding the stretcher.

> "You two want me to give you a minute, or should I go build you a chapel?"

> "Shut it," Tashigi and you say at the same time.

---

**OOC: Palace medical wing is on standby.**  
You'll be evacuated, placed under observation, and restricted from combat for the next few days.

---

As Tashigi kneels beside the stretcher and guides your battered body onto it, her touch is *surprisingly gentle*. She doesn't look away once. Doesn't hide the way her brow furrows, or how her lips twitch when you wince.

She mutters under her breath, barely audible.

> "Next time, we go down together."

---

Would you like to:

1. {Reply seriously-tell her that's not an option. Someone always has to live.}  
2. {Reply with humor-"If you want a joint grave, at least let me pick the headstone."}  
3. {Stay quiet. Just give her hand a squeeze while you're carried away.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - Fuck no. If I can save a life, I'm saving a life. If I can your life, I'm definitely saving your life.

Use some kiwi juice to soothe some of the burns.

>> ASSISTANT: **[On the Road Back to Alubarna - Evacuation Stretcher, Late Afternoon]**  
**Scene: "Conviction on the Cobblestone"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Earnest | Mood: Vulnerable, Steeled, Intimate**

---

The stretcher creaks beneath you, carried carefully by one guard in front and another at the rear. **The desert wind has shifted cooler**, evening clouds rolling in to cast **dappled shadows** across the sand-blasted trail leading back to the capital.

Tashigi walks beside you, quiet, hands folded behind her back like a cadet on silent duty. Her expression is fixed forward-guarded. But you can feel the tension **in her shoulders**, the way her steps slow each time she looks at you out of the corner of her eye.

She thinks she's hiding it.

She's not.

---

> "Next time," she'd said.  
> "We go down together."

---

You grunt, managing to raise a **shaking hand**, drawing the smallest bit of kiwi juice to your palm.

It's golden, sticky-sweet this time-**your subconscious desire to comfort reflected in its flavor.** You gently smear it over a **nasty patch of burn** at your side, hissing under your breath as the cool salve begins to **ease the pain** and slow the bubbling soreness.

Then you turn your head toward her. Voice hoarse, but **unyielding**.

> "Fuck no."

She blinks, taken aback.

You push through the pain, lock eyes with her.

> "If I can save a life, I'm saving a life. *Any* life."

> "If I can save *your* life?"

You breathe out slowly. A bit of blood catches on your lower lip, but you wipe it off with the back of your sleeve.

> "Then I'm *definitely* saving your life."

---

The guards exchange a glance but wisely say nothing.

Tashigi slows in her step, staring at you now-fully, openly. Like she doesn't know whether to yell at you, slap you, or sit down beside you and never leave again.

---

Finally, she mutters, voice low, nearly swallowed by the wind:

> "...you really are the most irresponsible responsible adult I've ever met."

> "I contain multitudes," you rasp.

She shakes her head. Then-slowly-reaches out and **places one gloved hand lightly over yours**, careful of the juice but still... grounded. Present.

She doesn't let go the rest of the walk back.

---

**OOC: Scene concluded.**  
You are returned to the palace under immediate care.  
Your wounds are now considered **healing**, but you remain **combat-ineffective** for 2 in-game days.  
**Tashigi remains close**. She speaks little, but your bond has solidified beyond mere duty.

**Progression Gained:**
- [x] Kiwi Fruit - Passive Use: Minor Soothing/Healing Effect (Limited use, non-combat)  
- [x] Emotional Anchor: "Tashigi's Survival = Non-Negotiable Priority"  
- [x] New Title (Unofficial): *The Most Irresponsible Responsible Adult* - as dubbed by Ensign Tashigi

---

Would you like to skip to your return to the palace infirmary, or rest with Tashigi present for one final post-mission moment?

>> USER: ​Arrive at the palace in the stretcher. Rumors of the Kiwi Knight being killed chasing Baroque agents float around.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Royal Palace, Outer Courtyard]**  
**Scene: "The Return of the Fallen(?)"**  
**POV: You (Stretcher-Bound), Tashigi (Beside You)**  
**Tone: Somber Arrival | Mood: Shifting from Grief to Confusion to Relief**

---

The **palace gates swing open**, and for a moment, the sun gleams dramatically over the domes and spires of the capital like a **hero's last curtain call.**

Except the hero is on a **wooden stretcher**, bruised, bleeding, and swearing under his breath about **insurance coverage.**

---

**Rumors beat you to the palace.**

By the time the guards rush to receive you, a **buzz has rippled through the city's recovery crews** and soldiers.

Whispers abound.

> "He's the one who summoned the elemental..."  
> "They say he shielded Ensign Tashigi from a bomb-didn't make it."  
> "I heard he went out like a knight. Didn't even scream."  
> "What was his name again? Kii-something?"  
> "Snackpack-sensei?"  
> "No, *Pineapple-sama.*"  
> "...Didn't he work at a school?"  
> "A *what?!*"

---

You catch fragments of the crowd, voices blending together like a surreal eulogy.

A Marine lieutenant starts saluting when he sees the stretcher.

A few palace medics **pause with visible surprise** when they realize you're-somehow-**still breathing.**

---

> "Wait-he's alive?"  
> "That's him? He's not... juiced?"

One medic fumbles with a clipboard. Another drops his flask.

> "He's even making *jokes.*"

---

Tashigi walks beside the stretcher like a quiet specter, her hand still loosely resting on the frame. She says nothing to the gathering crowd, **eyes forward, jaw tight.**

But the **rumor tide doesn't stop.**

Not even as the medics lift you inside.

Not even as the infirmary doors swing shut behind you.

---

**Inside the medical wing**, Vivi paces frantically beside your assigned bed, having just been briefed. Her eyes go wide as they wheel you in, and she bolts to your side.

> "You're not dead!!"

> "Was hoping to keep that part a surprise," you croak.  
> "Didn't want to spoil the ending."

---

She leans down, brushing her fingers through your hair-not scolding, not teasing-just relief, raw and unfiltered.

Tashigi speaks quietly behind her.

> "He shielded me. Took the worst of it."

> "Again?" Vivi mutters, brows knitting.  
> "He's going to keep doing this, isn't he?"

> "Unfortunately... yes," Tashigi replies, her voice almost fond. Almost.

---

**OOC: The palace believes you nearly died.**

- Your legend among local soldiers, reconstruction teams, and even some young nobles has *intensified*.  
- Rumors range from heroic sacrifice to tragic romance to *you transforming into juice at will* (thanks, Snack Pack rumors).  
- The tale of the **Kiwi Knight**-a wandering bounty hunter who gave his life protecting a marine and a princess-is already **taking root in song.**

Would you like to:

1. {Play dead a little longer. Ham it up. You're in too much pain to stop them.}  
2. {Insist you're fine. "Not dead yet!" You want credit for surviving, damn it.}  
3. {Reach up, grab Vivi or Tashigi's wrist, and make a quiet joke to lighten their relief.}
