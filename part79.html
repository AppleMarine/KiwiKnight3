<pre> climb. Describe the dreamlike moment you reach upward.}

>> USER: ​Option X - whatever's under my head sure is soft though. Comfy nap material.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Inside the Mind - The Softest Pillow at the End of the World]**  
**Scene: "Cushions of Confusion"**  
**Tone: Absurd Comfort | Mood: Blackout with Perks**

---

The void hums.

That strange *fuzzy buzz* of drifting consciousness, like the radio static between waking up and forgetting your own name.

Your entire body is aching, bruised, and barely functioning...

But your **head?**

Perfect.

Positively **cradled**.

Like the world's most luxurious pillow just **volunteered for a suicide mission**.

---

> "Mmm..."

You shift slightly, your face **nuzzling into the warmth.**

It's not stone.

It's **not cobblestone.**

It's definitely not a kiwi.

No, it's...

Something **squishier**.

Pliable.

Soft in a way that whispers *you probably shouldn't ask questions.*

---

> "Mmm. Good pillow."

You mumble it like it's the final review of your afterlife accommodations.

You drool, just a little.

Maybe it's blood. Maybe it's kiwi. You're not even sure anymore.

---

**Outside, in the real world-**

**Vivi's face turns slowly red.**  
She's very aware now of where your head has landed-  
**squarely in her lap.**

**Tashigi's face contorts.**  
Conflicted between mortified amusement and *do I slap him again?*

---

You murmur again:

> "Don't suppose this is memory foam..."

---

**Tashigi:** "Unbelievable."  
**Vivi:** "H-he's... lucid?!"  
**Tashigi:** "I think his *dignity* is dead. But yes."

---

Suddenly-

A *pulse*.

From the plaza.

From the **Elemental.**

It **glows again**.

It **twists-slowly**.

A hand raises.

Eyes open.

Faint, but **brightening.**

---

**Crocodile narrows his eyes.**

> "What now-?"

---

And you?

You remain nestled like a baby in a fruit-scented coma.

You are the calm in the storm.

The **human hot water bottle** of war.

---

**OOC:**
You are half-awake.

Lucid, but still not functional.  
The **Elemental is stabilizing**.  
Luffy has noticed. Crocodile is about to act.

Would you like to:

1. {Mutter a warning. You're awake enough to speak.}  
2. {Attempt to stand. Very funny. Very sad.}  
3. {Let someone else take initiative-maybe the girls. Maybe the juice god.}

>> USER: ​Enjoy the supposed memory foam. Exquisite.

The elemental remains still

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Most Exquisite Nap in a Warzone]**  
**Scene: "The Delirious Majesty of Rest"**  
**Tone: Surreal Comedy | Mood: Danger Be Damned, This Nap Slaps**

---

You don't move.  
You don't speak.  
You barely breathe.

But your head?

Cradled in the lap of a princess, in the middle of a revolution, under the heat of a desert sun and the gaze of gods and warlords?

**Exquisite.**

---

Your lips part, and the faintest whisper leaks out, content and blissfully stupid:

> "...This pillow is noble. Royal, even..."

> "10/10. Would nap again."

---

**Vivi freezes.** Her eyes wide. Face crimson.

**Tashigi's jaw drops.**

> "Is he-*is he lucid or delusional??*"

**Chopper** (somewhere nearby): "Yes."

---

The world is cracking apart.  
**Luffy's fists are splitting air.**  
**Crocodile is about to unleash a sandstorm shaped like vengeance and hubris.**  
A literal **kiwi god** is idling above you like an uncertain security drone-

And you?

You are **wrapped in bliss**.

---

Above, the **Elemental** remains still.

It watches.

It feels your presence again.

But without direction, it hesitates.

It breathes.

Juice sloshes.

But it **does not move**.

---

**Crocodile sneers.**

> "Your pet's broken again."

His arm lifts, coiling with sand blades.

He takes aim-**not at Luffy-**

**At the plaza.**

---

**Tashigi looks up.**

Eyes wide.

> "Shit-he's targeting *us.*"

---

**Vivi clutches you tighter.**

Not out of embarrassment.

Out of instinct.

> "Move. *Eatone, please move.*"

---

**The Elemental pulses.**

And waits.

---

**OOC:**
You are dangerously close to a character death if Crocodile's next attack hits the plaza.  
The Elemental may react-but only with your awareness behind it.  
Your consciousness is *stable*, but deeply entrenched in blissful idiocy.

Would you like to:

1. {Force a whisper. A command. A plea. Something to rouse the Elemental.}  
2. {Twitch-just enough. Let instinct take over.}  
3. {Say something utterly wrong, but maybe emotionally true.}

>> USER: ​Continue enjoying my well deserved nap. Maybe nestle in a bit.

OOC: they may attempt other actions to wake me up

The elemental remains still. It looks comfy, even. Somehow

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Sleep of the Unwise and Unbothered]**  
**Scene: "A Nap That Could End a Nation"**  
**Tone: Comedic Tragedy | Mood: Cosmic-level Facepalm**

---

The battle rages above.  
Sand slices the sky.  
Luffy shouts through bloodied teeth.  
Crocodile raises his arm to deliver a blow **meant to erase you and anyone around you from existence.**

---

And you?

You sigh softly.

**Content.**

Your head snuggles deeper into what you're absolutely, unquestionably convinced is a goose-feather memory foam pillow stitched by angels.

> "Mmm... Warm... regal... lavender-scented..."

You shift slightly.

One leg kicks out weakly in that **involuntary dreamt-of-stairs way.**

> "Mmm... ten more minutes..."

---

**Vivi turns beet red.**  
Her entire posture stiffens.

**Tashigi's eye twitches.** She is rapidly approaching a tactical slap.

---

> "We're about to be vaporized, and he's *nuzzling my thigh like it's a holiday hammock!*" Vivi hisses.

Tashigi exhales sharply, slapping her palm to her face.

> "I am going to court-martial him if we live."

---

**Meanwhile:**

The **Kiwi Elemental**, twenty feet tall and filled with Hero Water, observes you.  
Then, slowly...

It **sits.**

**Cross-legged.**

Like a **glowing green monk** waiting for its next command.  
A thin trickle of juice runs from its chin like drool.

It looks...

**Peaceful.**

Possibly also asleep.

---

**Crocodile's eyes gleam.**

His sand spear rises higher, *twisting*, ready to launch.

> "Say goodbye, princess."

---

**Tashigi throws Vivi back.**

**She stands between Crocodile's strike and your prone form.**

Sword shaking in her grip.  
Eyes burning.

> "You're not touching him. Not one damn grain of you."

---

**OOC:**

Your nap is now a tactical liability.  
Crocodile is seconds away from striking the entire plaza with a lethal sand storm.  
Tashigi is preparing to intercept with her body.  
The Elemental mirrors your rest state-unless forcibly roused.

Would you like them to:

1. {Slap. Very hard.}
2. {Use one of your own powers against you. Mist, juice-whatever works.}
3. {Say something deeply personal. Desperate. Risky.}
4. {Do all of the above.}

>> USER: ​Option 3

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - Breaking Through the Shell]**  
**Scene: "The Words That Might Reach Him"**  
**Tone: Raw | Mood: The Final Plea**

---

You remain cradled in a lap you should not deserve, whispering half-dream nonsense into chaos incarnate.  

Above, the Elemental imitates your posture with tranquil serenity. A citrus monk in meditation. A god of inertia. A monument to nap-based problem solving.

Crocodile's spear sharpens into a whirlwind tip, coiled tight. He isn't aiming to wound anymore-**he's aiming to *erase***.

---

**Tashigi grips her sword-but it shakes.**

She knows her blade isn't fast enough to stop **a storm**.  
Her eyes dart to the sky, to the sand, then back to you.

---

> "Dammit..."

She drops her blade and grabs you by the collar, shaking you now-not violently, but desperately.

She leans down, eyes blazing, forehead touching yours.

> "You told me I wasn't alone."

> "You told me kids shouldn't have to bleed for the mistakes of their elders."

Her voice breaks.

> "So *don't make us do it alone.*"

---

She swallows.

> "You think I don't see what you are? You're not a coward. You're not a joke."

Her fingers tighten, trembling</pre>
