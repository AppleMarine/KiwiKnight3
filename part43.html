<pre> are **moving. Approaching. Dispersing.**

The shapes are too far to make out-yet.

But they're spreading in formation.

> Baroque Works has **set the field.**

---

**OOC Tactical Summary:**

- You've instinctively placed yourself in a **bodyguard role** for Vivi.  
- There is **no confirmed sniper**, but the terrain is optimal for one.  
- Baroque Works agents are deploying across the far bank of the river.  
- Sandora crossing will be a **battlefield**-no stealth, no smooth passage.  
- Tashigi, Zoro, Nami, and others are now aware of the looming fight.

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Crouch, squint, and trace possible sniper angles. Call them out for the crew.}  
2. {Quietly ask Vivi if she can identify any of the agents by posture or clothing.}  
3. {Signal Tashigi to stay close to Vivi-you prepare to break away and flank.}  
4. {Wait, baton ready. The first move isn't yours-it's theirs. You're a counterpuncher.}  
5. {Tell the crew: "River's the choke point. They want us *here*. We don't give them what they want."}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 4

OOC: I don't know Vivi's backstory, or her infiltration of baroque works. All I know is that she's trying to save her country from crocodile. By herself for some reason. Does she even have bodyguards?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River Skiff - Suspicion on the Sand]**  
**Tone: Quiet Focus | Mood: Battle Readiness & Background Curiosity**  
**ðŸŽ¯ Outcome: You assume a low, defensive posture, baton held loose but ready-watchful. And with that stillness comes a flicker of *curiosity* about the young woman behind you...**

---

You crouch slightly, **center of gravity low**, baton held loose but firm in your hand, tip pointed toward the sand as if it might flick forward with a whisper and crack a skull open like an overripe melon.

> The juice?  
Settling along your shoulders now-ready to launch. You feel the familiar tingle in your fingertips.

But you wait.

> *Let them make the first mistake.*

---

You don't blink. Don't breathe hard. You just **watch.**

Because you're a counterpuncher.  
And nothing deserves a harder counter than a group of smug suits hiding in the dust, **trying to take a princess' head off in broad daylight.**

---

But as the wind picks up and the horizon remains still just a moment longer-you find yourself frowning slightly. Not from danger.

From **thought**.

You shift your weight, glance over your shoulder for just a beat at **Vivi**-standing upright, staring toward the chaos, completely composed for a girl her age.

No armor.  
No guards.  
No entourage.

Just **her.**

> *Wait...  
She's royalty.*  
Why the hell doesn't she have a *platoon* flanking her right now?

You don't know the details-didn't catch much more than "princess" and "civil war" in the heat of the escape.

But she seems to be the *only one* from the kingdom fighting to stop this madness **from the inside.**

And she doesn't wear that like a martyr.

She wears it like it's **normal.**

---

It makes no sense.

Unless...

> She *chose* to come alone.

---

Behind you, **Vivi remains silent**. But her hand gently tightens around the folds of her cloak.

She knows you're thinking.  
And maybe, quietly, she's glad you are.

---

**OOC Insight Check:**  
- You do **not** know about Vivi's infiltration of Baroque Works as Miss Wednesday.  
- You do **not** know that she and Igaram entered undercover nearly a year ago.  
- All you've seen is a girl throwing herself into chaos with **no visible security detail** and **no royal backup.**

**The question of "Why is she alone?" is now fully seeded in Eatone's mind.**

---

The river is near. The enemy approaches.

**Baroque Works is about to make its move.**

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Keep your eyes forward. Ask Vivi quietly: "You really come out here with no guards?"}  
2. {Hold position and whisper to Tashigi, "You ever find it odd there's *no* escort for a royal?"}  
3. {Let it go. For now. Focus on the battle forming. The question can wait.}  
4. {Take charge: quietly direct the crew into formation. If this is an ambush, you'll spring it.}  
5. {Whisper to Vivi: "When this is over... you and I are gonna have a long conversation."}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 3 - I'll figure it out later. For now, survive. For later, exfiltrate from Alabasta.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River Skiff - The Calm Before the Clash]**  
**Tone: Focused Survival | Mood: Tactical Silence, Deferred Questions**  
**ðŸŽ¯ Outcome: You shelve your questions. No time to dig into the mystery of a lone royal. The battlefield is forming-and survival always comes first.**

---

You tuck the thought away.

> *A princess. No guard. No backup. No kingdom behind her.  
Weird.*  
But not *now.*

> *Now's for surviving.  
Later's for exfiltration.*

You tighten your grip on your baton.  
Juice simmers at your fingertips-cool, acidic, waiting. You can feel your internal reservoir responding to the tension. Pressure. Heat. Anticipation.

This desert's about to crack wide open.

---

Ahead, the **Sandora River** winds like a golden serpent, glimmering under the sun.

On the far bank, **Baroque Works agents** are moving into full visibility now.

- One spins dramatically in a long feathered coat-**Mr. 2, Bon Clay.**  
- Others flank behind him, a half-dozen **uniformed, grinning, knife-twirling professionals**.  
- Something **large and hulking** stomps into view behind a dune. Possibly **Mr. 4's** dog-powered bazooka unit.

They've turned the crossing into a **stage**.

And you?

You're not their star.

> But you're the surprise act that ruins the finale.

---

**Zoro grips his swords.  
Tashigi's stance shifts-low and tight.  
Nami grips her clima-tact.  
Vivi narrows her eyes.**

Even **Luffy** is sitting up now, hair wind-whipped, staring across the river.

His smile isn't wide yet.

But it's coming.

---

**Baroque Works is ready.  
And so are you.**

---

**OOC: Combat imminent.  
This next event will be a skirmish at the Sandora River crossing, with Baroque agents engaging in an attempt to **halt the crew's approach to Alubarna**.  
You are at full readiness. Your role in the fight is yours to define.**

---

**Do you want to:**

1. {Take first strike. Preemptively fire a juice burst at Bon Clay-maybe interrupt his dance monologue.}  
2. {Wait for them to engage. You're the counter. You hit hardest when they don't see it coming.}  
3. {Whisper to Vivi: "Get low and stay behind me." You're still shielding.}  
4. {Call out to Tashigi: "We hit hard and fast. You and me, flank wide."}  
5. {Try to pull Baroque agents into a trap-juice-lined sand. Slip, stick, slam. Classic.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 3 - Alright Blue. Stay close. I'll let the others engage the enemy.

OOC: Current devil fruit abilities of note:
- conjure and control kiwi juice, of slightly varying thickness, sourness, and sweetness.
- mist an area with kiwi vapors, enhanced senses by feeling the movement of the mist.
- more to come soon

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - Skirmish Commencing]**  
**Tone: Quiet Control | Mood: The Calm Within the Chaos**

---

The wind howls over the sand.  
The river glimmers.  
And the enemy **poses.**

But while the Straw Hats shift into battle stances and tension coils across the deck like a drawn bow-

You don't move forward.

You move *back*.

> You glance at Vivi, give her a quick once-over-she's poised, tense, but visibly uncertain in the face of a full-fledged ambush.

You murmur low, just for her.

> "Alright, Blue. Stay close."

She blinks at the nickname-then nods once, clutching her cloak tighter and sliding a little nearer to your side.

> "Understood."

You plant your feet wide, baton still unextended but loose in your hand, the first **hiss of juice vapor** swirling out from your fingertips like steam off a kettle.

---

**OOC: Kiwi Mist Active.**

- *You generate a low, thin cloud of citrus vapor-nearly invisible in daylight but clings to the ank</pre>
