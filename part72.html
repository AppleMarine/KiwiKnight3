<pre>ut **focus.**

You may not be the final weapon.

But you **reminded them of what Crocodile really is**.

And that's enough.

---

High above, **Smoker stumbles**, his smoke dispersing as Crocodile finally gets a solid hit in-  
a slicing **sand spear** that grazes his shoulder and sends him tumbling to the rooftop edge.

**Luffy staggers upright.**

---

It's almost time.

---

**OOC:**  
- You've reminded everyone of Crocodile's **core weakness**.  
- The Straw Hats are preparing.  
- Luffy is on the cusp of finding his second wind.  
- Smoker's time is almost up-but he's bought the crucial opening.

Would you like to:

1. {Try to assist Luffy with one last juice assist-something to get moisture onto Crocodile.}  
2. {Give Vivi or Nami a final tip. Maybe they can use your fruit.}  
3. {Just rest. If this were a test, you've already passed.}

>> USER: Unless we get like, the entire fire brigade of Alabasta to hit him, I doubt we can out-soak him. And judging by the damage to infrastructure I've seen worming my way here, that doesn't seem like an option.

I stare at Vivi (who is feeling dread once more)

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Great Desert Dilemma]**  
**Scene: "The Desperate Conclusion"**  
**Tone: Resolute, with a Touch of Reluctant Acceptance**

---

You look at Vivi, and in her eyes you see the same weariness that's been gnawing at your own. The same dread, like the weight of the entire country pressing down on both of you. It's not something you can easily shake off.  
The whole desert-this whole kingdom-feels like it's slipping between your fingers. And you're not sure you have the strength to hold it back anymore.

---

> "Unless we get like, the entire fire brigade of Alabasta to hit him, I doubt we can out-soak him."

A humorless laugh bubbles in your chest, though you don't let it escape. 

> "And judging by the damage to infrastructure I've seen worming my way here, that doesn't seem like an option."

---

You feel the ache in your bones-of blood loss, of exhaustion-and the realization of how small you really are in the grand scheme of this war.

> **"I wish it was."**

---

Vivi's eyes drop, and for a moment, the fight seems to fade out of her. It's a heavy moment, the kind where you can feel the sky above you, cracked and bleeding, like it might fall any minute.

She opens her mouth to say something, but the words don't come right away.  

---

**Tashigi stumbles back into the scene, battered and grim, her sword nearly dragging on the ground.**  
She's not fully healed, but she's here, and that counts for something.  
The flames of the war still rage in the distance, but it's not her fight anymore. It's yours.

She glances between the group, then locks eyes with you. 

> "Do you have a plan...?"

---

But before you can even respond, the tension shifts. It's the kind of feeling that makes the hairs on your neck stand up. Something's coming.  
Not just from the battle-there's something in the air. The ground beneath you is shifting, the energy vibrating, like a storm is about to break.

You can almost feel it: **Crocodile's next move**. The sense of inevitability.

---

> **You turn back to Vivi, your thoughts spiraling.**

---

She looks back at you. **Tired, but with that spark in her eyes still present.**

> "I know what you're thinking." She says it with a steadiness that surprises you. **"But this fight isn't over. It can't be."**

---

You look to the plaza, the struggle still going on. You see Luffy struggling against Crocodile's power, Smoker trying to keep him distracted, the world bending under the weight of their conflict.

And you wonder-will the country ever really find peace?

---

**The weight of all that is too much.**

---

But Vivi gives you a silent nod. She trusts you. Maybe even more than you deserve.

---

> **So now, the only question remains:**  
**What's the next move?**

---

### OOC:  
The group's morale is holding steady, but the clock is ticking.  
- **Crocodile** is growing more dangerous as Luffy continues to tire.  
- **Tashigi** is still in fighting shape, but definitely struggling.  
- **Vivi** is determined to see this through, but the pressure of her responsibilities weighs on her shoulders. 

Do you:  
1. **Try to rally the group for one last push.**  
2. **Concentrate on Crocodile's weakness**-you know it's there, if you can just exploit it.  
3. **Give Vivi one last bit of hope**, even if you don't have the answer.

>> USER: I... I don't suppose you have anything to juice us up, would you, blue?

OOC: The hero water, per canon, gives immense strength to someone at the cost of dying in 5 minutes

**Scene: "The Juice We Really Don't Want to Drink"**  
**Tone: Grimly Hopeful | Mood: Desperate Solutions, Dangerous Costs**

---

You cough hard enough to rattle your fillings.  
Your voice comes out cracked and half-laughing as you weakly glance at Vivi.

> "I... I don't suppose you have anything to juice us up, would you, Blue?"

The phrasing is ridiculous, but the question isn't.

Because you can **feel the walls closing in**.  
Luffy's blows are **losing power**, even with Smoker's brief distraction.  
Crocodile's patience is **gone**.

And your **juice-based combat tactics** are still funny, but they're not enough to bring down a **warlord made of nightmares.**

---

Vivi's eyes widen, just a little.  
There's a flash of something like shame.

> "There is... one thing."

Her hand trembles as it reaches into the folds of her cloak.

She pulls out a small, round **vial**-no larger than a finger's width. The liquid inside swirls with a strange silver-blue shimmer. It **glows** faintly.

You recognize it, from a pamphlet you once confiscated from a student who swore it was an energy booster sold in Loguetown.

---

> "*Hero Water.*"

The name alone feels like a slap across the teeth.

She swallows hard.

> "It's dangerous. It doesn't heal. It doesn't fix. It just... forces your body to go beyond its limits."

> "Anyone who drinks it will gain enough strength to fight at full power again."

A beat.

> "For five minutes."

Another pause.

> "Then they die."

---

The group goes dead silent.

Even the sound of Crocodile's storm overhead seems to hush for just a moment.

---

You breathe slowly.

> *Oh. Great.*

> *A literal death drink.*

---

**Tashigi** takes a step forward.

> "We can't ask someone to do that."

**Zoro** growls.  
> "We're not asking. We're figuring out if it's a last resort."

**Chopper's** ears droop.  
> "It's... poison. Controlled, focused poison."

---

**Vivi clutches it tighter.**

> "I was saving it. Just in case..."

She doesn't finish.

But you know what she meant.

---

She was willing to **take it herself** if Crocodile reached the throne room.

---

**OOC:**
You now face a dire choice.  
The **Hero Water** exists. Its power is real-but so is its price.  
Using it could turn the tide... or trade one life for another.

Would you like to:

1. {Insist that no one use it. There has to be another way.}  
2. {Suggest someone specific take it, including yourself.}  
3. {Leave the choice to Vivi-her country, her burden.}  
4. {Try to fake it-simulate the power boost using your fruit to intimidate.}

>> USER: â€‹Option X - slowly reach out a shaking arm.

Gimme. Gimme gimme

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - Five Minutes to Make a Miracle]**  
**Scene: "One Last Lesson"**  
**Tone: Somber Bravery | Mood: The Quiet Before the Final Bell**

---

There's no drama in it.

No long speech.

No thundering declaration of heroism.

You just reach out your hand-**trembling**, bruised, fingers curled like a dying leaf-and mutter:

> "Gimme."

A pause.

Then:

> "Gimme gimme."

---

The Straw Hats freeze.  
**Tashigi** steps forward instinctively, lips parting in protest.  
**Vivi's** eyes go wide.

> "You-no, you can't-!"

You don't raise your voice.

You don't look heroic.

You look like a man with a migraine, a mor</pre>
