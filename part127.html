You hear a choked sound from the right.

**Vivi is stifling a laugh**, her hand covering her mouth, trying to appear respectful. She's failing spectacularly.

Tashigi, however-

She stands just to your left, arms crossed.

And gives you the kind of look that **could've bent steel.**

---

> "Mine's fine," she says flatly, "unlike someone who used it like a sandbag filled with fruit pulp."

You grin up at her. You can't see her, not from this angle, but you can feel her *glower* rolling over your cocooned form like a thundercloud with glasses.

> "You're welcome," you chirp.

---

> "You're incorrigible," she replies, stepping over and pressing a fresh, blessedly cold towel to your neck.

> "And you're terrible at accepting help."

> "I'm great at accepting breakfast," you counter.

---

Vivi raises an eyebrow.

> "You're also apparently good at accepting near-death experiences. That's what-third time?"

> "Two and a half," you mumble. "I wasn't technically dead after the gator cannonball. Just *really inconvenienced.*"

---

A palace aide finally arrives with a silver tray laden with **warm honey bread, a small side of grilled spiced fish, dates, cheese**, and to your surprise-

> "No kiwis?" you ask.

The aide blinks.

> "...The princess gave *strict* orders."

Vivi crosses her arms and nods proudly.

> "I banned them from your diet. Medical reasons."

**OOC: You've earned full recovery within 48 in-game hours.**

During this time, you can:

- Continue deepening relationships with key NPCs (Vivi, Tashigi, palace staff, Smoker)  
- Prepare for next steps (investigating Baroque remnants, the "402 NW" lead)  
- Explore the palace and interact with the increasingly colorful rumors around you  
- Or just... be a weird local hero with chronic back pain and a sense of civic duty.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Ask about any word from Smoker or Marine HQ. What's the response to the depot bombing?}  
2. {Ask Vivi and Tashigi what they'll do once things quiet down.}  
3. {Focus on eating. "Hero work's hungry work." Let them talk while you snack.}

>> USER: Option 3 - Enjoy the bread.

OOC - A long, detailed scene of Vivi and Tashigi contemplating recent events. When they were still fighting Crocodile, every disaster seemed normal. Manageable. But now that peace is returning, something like this... Stings. And the possibility of Eatone's death 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Royal Palace - Adjacent Courtyard, Evening]**  
**Scene: "Aftermath Echoes"**  
**POV: Vivi & Tashigi**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Uneasy Calm, Emotional Vulnerability**  
**Setting: The sun is falling behind Alubarna's western domes, casting long golden streaks through vine-draped colonnades. A low wind carries the scent of cactus blossoms and scorched masonry dust. The city breathes-but doesn't quite exhale. Not yet.**

---

**The infirmary grows quiet**, your slow, steady chewing the only sound behind the thin curtains.

Warm bread. Honey drizzle. A faint sigh of satisfaction.  
**Eatone Cheng is, for now, safe.**

But outside the curtained ward, under the open arch of a crumbling terrace where vines curl around burned sandstone columns-two women stand in thoughtful silence.

**Vivi, in her modest desert-blue dress, arms crossed. Tashigi, in partial Marine uniform, her sword hanging loose at her side.**

They've fought warlords.

They've faced assassination squads.

They've stood at the cliff's edge of **a nation's collapse.**

And yet-

---

> "This felt... different," Vivi finally says.

Her voice is soft. Not weak, but restrained-like a harpstring drawn too tight.

Tashigi doesn't answer right away. Her eyes are fixed on the **pool of moonlight gathering beneath a statue**-the one of Queen Nefertari Lili. A symbol of long-lost courage and ancient burdens.

> "It was smaller," Tashigi says at last. "Quieter. Just a crate. Just two agents."

> "But if he hadn't been there..."

> "I would have died."

Vivi flinches at how plainly Tashigi says it. There's no bravado. No denial. No elaborate rationalization.

Just *truth*.

---

> "I thought he was dead," Vivi whispers. "I believed it. I *felt* it. Like someone had taken something-no. Someone. Someone I hadn't even realized I'd come to count on."

Her arms tighten around herself.

> "It's strange. When we were still fighting Crocodile, everything was chaos. The idea of someone dying felt... remote. I knew it was possible, but I *couldn't focus* on it. There was always another battle, another plot."

She swallows hard, blinking into the fading light.

> "But now that it's quiet... now that we've won..."

> "Every threat feels louder," Tashigi finishes. "Sharper."

---

They stand a moment in silence, letting the breeze roll over them, brushing away heat and grief that refuses to fully settle.

> "You ever think about how he's not like us?" Vivi asks suddenly.

> "You mean *not legally allowed to hold a sword?*" Tashigi replies dryly.

Vivi gives a soft huff of a laugh, but shakes her head.

> "I mean he's not royalty. Not military. He's not even really a bounty hunter. He's just... a man. A teacher. Who got caught up in something that should never have touched his life."

---

Tashigi closes her eyes. She remembers the feel of his grip on her waist right before the blast. The heat. The ring in her ears. The sickening moment where she was sure he was gone.

> "He doesn't act like a soldier," she murmurs. "But he fights like someone who's trying to protect something he doesn't think he deserves to hold."

> "Or someone," Vivi whispers.

---

Another long silence.

Then Vivi turns, slowly, her voice lower now.

> "I'm glad he didn't die."

> "...Me too."

---

From behind the curtain, your voice drifts sleepily:

> "Did I hear my name? Or is this just the honey bread talking...?"

---

Tashigi rolls her eyes with a sigh.

Vivi smiles, warmth returning like morning sun over the ruins.

> "It's definitely the bread."

---

**OOC: Bond Event Unlocked - "Quiet Moments After the Storm"**  
- **Vivi:** Connection solidified. Emotional reliance deepening.  
- **Tashigi:** Trust hardened through crisis. Protective instincts have crystallized.  
- Their relationship with each other has also deepened-tied together by shared battle, mutual loss, and the man they nearly lost.

---

Would you like to continue from the infirmary the next morning, or explore a brief night scene first-perhaps dreams, or quiet conversations with either woman?

>> USER: Night Scene. I am peaceful asleep. Still looking like a burnt cocoon.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Royal Palace - Infirmary, Deep Nightfall]**  
**Scene: "Burnt Cocoon, Beating Heart"**  
**POV: External - Observing Eatone at Rest**  
**Tone: Quiet | Mood: Tender, Reflective, Healing**

---

The moonlight streams through the **arched window**, casting soft silvers across the stone floor, where once only dust and firelight danced.

You lie still in your bed, your form wrapped in **so many bandages** you resemble some vaguely tropical-themed sarcophagus. Your hair is matted against the pillow, a patch of dried juice clinging to the corner of your jaw.

Your chest rises and falls in a steady rhythm-**a survivor's breath**, deeper than it was when they first brought you in.

No twitching.

No groaning.

Just peace.

---

You don't hear the **soft footfalls** that cross the room, sandal against stone, nor the **swish of a Marine coat** folding neatly onto a chair. You don't feel the **presence at your bedside** settle in with a sigh.

But she's there.

---

**Tashigi sits in the chair beside you**, legs crossed, her sword propped nearby but **not within immediate reach**-a rare vulnerability from a woman who sleeps with a hand on the hilt.

She watches you in silence.

The bandages on your face make you look **younger**, somehow. A little ridiculous. A little tragic. A lot brave.

> "Still looks like he's going to mutter something about paperwork," she murmurs, half to herself.

She pulls a small cloth from her sleeve and gently,</pre>
