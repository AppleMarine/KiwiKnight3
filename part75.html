<pre>?"

It's the last thing you manage to mumble before the world turns green.

---

The **tiny elemental**, once barely knee-height and endearingly lumpy, suddenly **tenses**. Its round shape **quivers**-like someone just lit a fuse inside a fruit-shaped water balloon.

---

And then-

> **BOOM.**

A *verdant column* **erupts skyward**, exploding upward from the puddle like a geyser of tropical power.  
It **blasts through the air** with a sound like a *thunderclap wrapped in splashback*.

---

You're knocked **clean off your feet**, juice-soaked and stupefied.

> "GAH-!"

You sail back like a tossed sack of overripe groceries, colliding full-force into **Vivi** and **Tashigi**, sending all three of you into a **very undignified, citrusy dogpile**.

---

> *THUD.*  
> *"Oof!"*  
> *"Mmphf-!"*

---

The crowd gasps.

And in front of them-

**Something monstrous takes shape.**

---

The **pillar of emerald** collapses inward, compresses, then reshapes-  
forming massive **arms**, a **torso**, and a churning, bubbling **core** that glows silver-blue like an unstable star.

A new **kiwi elemental** rises.

But not tiny.

This one is **twenty feet tall**, shoulders wide as a ship, with swirling liquid veins pulsing like fire through gelatin.

Its eyes glow.

And then it roars.

> **RRRRAUUUUUGHHHH!!**

Juice sprays from its open maw like vaporized sugar.

---

**The Hero Water didn't empower *you*.**

It **evolved your fruit.**

And gave life to something **outside you.**

**Independent. Powerful. Unstable.**

---

**Crocodile's sandstorm halts.**  
The crowd turns.  
Even **Luffy**, mid-fight, stares down at the plaza below.

> "...What the hell is that?"

---

**Zoro mutters:**

> "Is that... pineapple guy's Stand?"

**Usopp:**

> "It's *alive?!*"

**Sanji:**

> "...That thing looks like it could take on the Sea Kings."

---

**OOC:**
- The kiwi elemental has *absorbed* the diluted Hero Water.
- It now stands as a semi-autonomous **powerhouse**, glowing with fruit-based rage and unknown limits.
- It's not directly under your control-but it *knows* you. And it *knows your will*.
- Crocodile has taken notice.
- Vivi and Tashigi are stunned (and slightly squished beneath you).

Would you like to:

1. {Attempt to command the elemental. It might respond.}  
2. {Try to stand. Rally. Lead. It might listen to leadership.}  
3. {Say something really dumb as you lay in the arms of two women beneath a juice god.}

>> USER: ​Option 3 - I... I didn't know fruit could roar.

**Tone: Ridiculous Awe | Mood: Shock and Tropics**  

---

The **kiwi elemental towers** above the plaza now-arms flexed, back arched, chest heaving with mist and purpose. The Hero Water surges visibly in its chest cavity like a **molten tropical reactor**, its core a churning mix of **silver-blue light and viridescent juice**.

Every living being in Alubarna has stopped what they're doing. The war. The arguments. The cheering. The crying.

They are all, to a person, just **staring** at this **glowing, fruit-flavored titan.**

---

**You, meanwhile, are lying tangled in a half-crushed pile of royalty and justice**, your limbs draped over **Tashigi's lap**, your back against **Vivi's hip**, blinking upward at the skyscraper of kiwi pulp now howling your emotional state into the heavens.

You murmur:

> "I... I didn't know fruit could roar."

---

**Tashigi:**  
> "W-what did you *do?*"

**Vivi:**  
> "What is it *doing??*"

---

Above, the elemental takes a step forward-  
**cobblestones shatter** beneath its translucent feet, juice splashing in all directions like a living tsunami.

Its fists clench.

Its body twists toward the palace.

Its **eyes lock on Crocodile.**

---

And from atop the roof-

**Crocodile frowns.**

For the first time.

---

He watches this emerald juggernaut take its first proper steps into **his battlefield**.

He mutters:

> "...What kind of Devil Fruit *is that?*"

---

And beside him, **Luffy grins.**

A tired, bloodied grin.

> "That's our juice guy."

---

**OOC:**
- You have summoned a one-time **Fruit Awakening manifestation**, supercharged by Hero Water.
- The elemental is **autonomous**, powerful, and acting in defense of you and Vivi.
- Crocodile is officially concerned.
- You, meanwhile, are still horizontal, injured, and incredibly confused.

Would you like to:
1. {Attempt to psychically influence the elemental through shared will.}  
2. {Let it go-see what it does next.}  
3. {Try to stand. Say something leader-like. Probably fall over again.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - Go! Get that mothafucka!

Your head's pounding.  
Your ribs are basically a jigsaw puzzle.  
You're sprawled across two confused women.  
And there's a **25-foot glowing juice elemental** standing on the battlefield like it owns the mineral rights.

---

So you do the only thing that makes sense.

You dig your **bloody fingers into the stone**, push yourself halfway upright, and with the voice of a man who just watched a kingdom burn, scream:

> "**GO!! GET THAT MOTHAFUCKA!!!**"

---

Your voice echoes across the plaza like a war horn made of citrus rage.

The elemental reacts **instantly**.

Its massive form twitches once-then shudders-then **lets loose a second roar**, this one loud enough to rattle windows and send a dozen seagulls flapping madly from the city walls.

It turns.

It **points a single dripping, glowing finger** at **Crocodile**.

Then it **launches forward**, each step a crater, each movement liquid thunder.

---

**Crocodile's eyes widen.**  
He barely has time to react.

> *CRASH!*

A colossal **fist of gelatinous might** slams down on the rooftop, **obliterating part of the palace corner**-  
**Crocodile leaps back**, sand swirling protectively, but he's **on the defensive** for the first time.

---

**Luffy, seeing the opening, lunges.**

> "Gomu Gomu no-"

> **"GATLING!!!"**

A barrage of fists rain in behind the elemental's assault.

Sand clashes with juice.

**Steel clashes with pulp.**

Hero Water **sizzles** through Crocodile's defenses.

The rooftop becomes a **maelstrom of fruit, fists, and fury.**

---

Below, the crowd **explodes** with cheers and terrified awe.

---

**Usopp:** "I knew he was hiding something! He had *kaiju energy*!"

**Zoro:** "That thing's stronger than *me.* I hate that it's stronger than me."

**Nami:** "If it wins, I'm naming it ‘Smoothie.'"

---

Vivi and Tashigi both stare in awe as the elemental **plows through Crocodile's outer sand barrier**, **driving him back across the roof.**

You?

You just slump down again, exhausted.

But grinning.

---

> "Good boy..."

> "Teach him what pulp can do."

---

**OOC:**
- Your command was heard. Loud and clear.
- The Kiwi Elemental is now engaged in **full-scale battle** with Crocodile, giving Luffy an opening to land real hits.
- The tide of battle is turning.
- You have fulfilled your role-for now.

Would you like to:
1. {Keep watching. Offer commentary. Maybe cry. Just a little.}  
2. {Pass out, dramatically. You've earned the nap.}  
3. {Attempt one final fruit-powered support act, even from the ground.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - Force myself to stay awake. The elemental might disperse if I pass out. I sure am having trouble though, that concussion from the armored headbutt is rearing its ugly head again.

Vivi and/or Tashigi may notice

You're shaking.

Vision's blurring.  
Ears ringing.  
The roar of the battle above is like thunder filtered through a waterlogged megaphone.

But you stay conscious.

**You *have* to.**

Because that **thing up there**-that roaring, silver-vein</pre>
