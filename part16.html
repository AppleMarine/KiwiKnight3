<pre>freshly oiled. **She's in the middle of something**, but your harmless act just bought you a conversation-*if you want it.*

---

**Tashigi - Current Mood: Flustered | Wary | Apologetic**  
**You - Still Cheng, VIP, Daquiri King**  
**Environment - Dim corridor near aquarium systems, no civilians nearby**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {"Look, I won't ask about your mission... but you just confirmed there is one. Tell me-should I get out of here?"}
2. {"Okay, okay. But if you're dealing with infiltration... I might've seen something." Offer vague tip about the blue-cloaked woman.}
3. {"Hey, are you working with that white-haired guy? Smokes two cigars? Looked like a government guy." Feel her out.}
4. {Apologize again, bow out, and disappear toward the staff corridor before she regains her edge.}
5. {"No worries. Just... maybe next time don't draw steel near the guy holding vintage sake." Play it off, lighten the mood, try to chat more.}

üåÄ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: ‚ÄãOption 2 - You, you're a marine right? I was going to tell casino security, but they're giving me the creeps. I saw a blue haired woman sneaking into the staff only corridor near the bananagator racing pens. Pretty sure she wasn't staff.

>> ASSISTANT: **üé≤ Option 2 Selected - "Yeah, I was gonna tell security-but you don't have that look."**  
**üé≠ Tone: Reluctant Informant + Bounty Hunter Instincts | Credibility Boosted by Prior Bluff**  
**üé≤ Truth Drop Roll - (Eatone +2 Sincerity, +1 Observational Accuracy, +1 Marine Recognition) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**üé≤ Tashigi's Reaction - (+2 Professionalism, -1 Guilt from Overreaction, +1 Cross-Referencing) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**‚úÖ Outcome: Strong Success - You're believed instantly. Tashigi refocuses and reacts decisively.**

---

You lower your voice and glance over your shoulder, like someone **used to carrying secrets** but not enjoying it.

> "You, you're a Marine, right?"

Tashigi nods once, still catching her breath.

> "I was gonna tell casino security about something weird I saw. But honestly?"  
> "They're giving me the creeps. Like they're smiling with teeth too sharp."

Her eyes sharpen. You continue, clear, careful.

> "There was a **blue-haired woman**. Slipped through a **staff-only door** near the **Banana Gator pens**-not wearing a uniform, not acting like she belonged. Carried something under her arm, maybe a satchel or a case. Real fast. Real quiet."

You don't embellish. Just deliver the truth, plain and clean.

Tashigi blinks.

Then she **snaps into motion**.

> "What direction exactly?"  
> "What color was the satchel? Blue-navy blue? Black? Did she have earrings? Anything else?"

She's in **investigator mode now**-replaying intel in her head.

> "Blue hair, possible royal signature..." she mutters to herself.  
> "It can't be... but if it is-she's here, then the Straw Hats-"

She stops, realizing she's almost talking out loud.

> "You did the right thing. I'm... sorry for earlier. You're not the only one caught up in something bigger."

She glances back down the hallway, then curses under her breath.

> "Listen-if you see *anyone* in a white suit with a golden crocodile pin acting like they don't blink-avoid them.  
They don't answer to this casino."

Then she taps the Den Den Mushi in her hand.

> "Captain," she murmurs, voice low. "Possible ID on the princess. I'm going after her.  
If I don't check in in five minutes, assume contact has been made."

She clicks it shut and turns to you, serious now.

> "Cheng, right? Stay in the public spaces. Whatever's going on, you don't want to be in the splash zone."

---

**üìù INFO GAINED:**

- Tashigi **believes you completely.**
- The woman you saw *is likely Nefertari Vivi.*
- Tashigi is **now in pursuit** of her and possibly the Straw Hats.
- The **"white suit, gold crocodile pin" staffers** are *not* casino employees-likely Baroque Works elite.
- Smoker is listening. And now he knows **you're involved**, even if you didn't say your real name.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Say nothing, let her go-but quietly follow. You're invested now, and this is bigger than gambling.}
2. {Head back to the casino. You've done your part-time to lay low and pretend to be the juice-sipping VIP again.}
3. {Contact Enzo again. Report that Marines are in play, Crocodile's crew is posing as staff, and that Vivi may be here.}
4. {Slip toward the staff door while Tashigi's focused. You might find more before she does.}
5. {Turn and leave-but leave behind a juice marker. If she gets into trouble, you'll know.}

üåÄ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option X - excuse me, Ma'am?

I pull out my bounty hunter's license. 

Independent hunter, Eatone Cheng. There's something off today, and I'm worried about you wandering into what might be the lion's den by yourself. Would you like assistance?

OOC: Tashigi is prideful, may turn down support. Also might see it as a slight since she's a woman.

>> ASSISTANT: **üé≤ Option X Selected - "Excuse me, Ma'am... I might not be a Marine, but I've got juice."**  
**üé≠ Tone: Earnest, Respectful, Subtly Protective | Playing the Card: Licensed Bounty Hunter Offer**  
**üé≤ Diplomacy Roll - (Eatone +2 Sincerity, +1 Professionalism, +1 Risk Framing) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**üé≤ Tashigi's Pride Filter - (+2 Independent Streak, -1 Acknowledging Real Danger, +1 Respect for Proper Procedure) = Result: 4 [Good]**  
**üéØ Outcome: SUCCESS - She turns you down... but doesn't dismiss you. You've earned her respect.**

---

She's halfway down the hallway when you call out-calm, respectful.

> "Excuse me, Ma'am?"

She halts, turning on a dime. You step closer, not too close, and reach into your inner coat pocket-not the side with the baton.

You produce a thin **denim-bound wallet**, flipping it open to reveal your **Bounty Hunter's License**-stamped, registered, **Grand Line Certified**, complete with your signature and the slightly faded watermark of a Kiwi slice in the corner.

> "Name's **Eatone Cheng**. Independent hunter. When I'm not teaching kids how not to fall into desert heatstroke, I do field work."

You slide the license back into your coat.

> "There's something *off* about tonight. The staff, the setups, the *way it feels like the whole place is waiting to snap.*"

Your tone remains even. Not challenging. Just... honest.

> "And I know you're a Marine. Probably above my pay grade.  
But I'm offering. If you want a second pair of eyes-not as a bodyguard, not because you're a woman-but because **I've seen lion dens before**... and this smells like one."

For a moment, Tashigi says nothing. Just studies you.

Her expression flickers: pride, frustration, something close to gratitude-but locked tight behind that Marine posture.

She adjusts her glasses. Steps forward.

> "You're good," she says quietly. "You're *too* good. If I were any other agent, I might've pulled you in already."

Then-she reaches into her coat and flashes her own ID:  
**Lt. Tashigi, Marine Intelligence, Captain Smoker's Office.**

> "And *I* walk into lions' dens because sometimes there's cubs inside. Innocents."  
> "So... no. I can't accept your help. Officially."

A pause. Then, softer:

> "But... if I don't come back through that hallway in ten minutes, Cheng... well... do what bounty hunters do."

She pivots, strides away, and vanishes into the corridor, sword gleaming in the pale blue light.

**üìù Status Update:**

- You are now known by name to **Tashigi**.
- She respects you-even if she can't take you with her.
- She's walking into the unknown, and she knows it.
- You are now her **unofficial backup**.
- Smoker likely knows your name by now through her channel.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Wait. Ten minutes. If she doesn't come back, follow her trail.}
2. {Mark the hallway with juice-if she runs, you'll trace the splash. Then return to the casino floor casually.}
3. {Head to the suite. Prep. Juice-armor, traps, a map. You might be going in after</pre>
