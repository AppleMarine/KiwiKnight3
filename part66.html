>> ASSISTANT: **[Split Perspective - Above and Below the Kingdom]**  
**Scene A: "The Crocodile's Gambit"**  
**Scene B: "Steel Steps Forward"**  
**Tone: Rising Stakes | Mood: Pride vs. Power**

---

### **Scene A - Palace Roofline**

**Crocodile stands high above the chaos.**  
Cloak flowing. Sand whispering at his heels like a loyal hound.

Next to him:  
**King Cobra.**  
Bound. Bruised. Head bowed-but still breathing.

Crocodile's voice carries over the entire city square like a king addressing his new court.

---

> "You all wanted the truth?"  
> "Here it is."

He places a gloved hand on Cobra's shoulder, not hard-just **possessive**.

> "Your king has been hiding secrets beneath this very palace. Forbidden knowledge-sacrificing you all while clutching power the World Government has deemed... dangerous."

---

He grins wide.

> "And while you squabble and bleed, I'll be taking that power."

He turns slightly, not even looking at Cobra as he continues:

> "Alabasta was never the goal. It was just the doorway."

> "And your loyalty, your rebellions, your tears?"

He shrugs.

> "Collateral."

---

From the plaza below, **Vivi shouts up**:

> "You're lying!"

Crocodile glances down-casually, as if noticing a fly.

> "Am I?"

---

His **sand swirls**, rising like a serpent around him. You can feel the heat tighten in your lungs.

---

### **Scene B - A Sword in the Dust**

Back in the side alley-half a district behind the plaza-**Tashigi lowers her hand from her transponder snail.**

She tried to call reinforcements again.

**No signal.**

The sky over the rooftops glows with the flashes of lightning and fire. The crowd's roar fills every gap in the buildings.

She breathes in.  
Then out.

Then turns back to you-slumped just inside the alley, half-conscious.

---

> "Crocodile's shown himself."

She says it calmly, but there's **something in her eyes**. Rage.  
And not just for the kingdom.

But for **you**-lying broken behind her.  
For **Vivi**, bleeding herself on hope.

For **everyone who's still just trying to do the right thing** while a monster tries to rewrite history.

---

She steps forward.

> "If he's going to bury this country..."

> "He'll have to get through my sword first."

---

She vanishes down the alley. Toward the fight.

---

And you?

You just barely shift on the cool cobblestone floor.

Still breathing.

Still listening.

Still alive.

---

**OOC Status:**  
- Crocodile has revealed himself. His goal is now openly connected to the **Poneglyph beneath the palace**.  
- King Cobra is alive, but **bound and powerless**.  
- Vivi's effort to end the war peacefully has been undone by Crocodile's manipulation-**but hope still flickers**.  
- Tashigi is en route to the plaza alone.  
- Eatone is recovering. You may re-enter soon-depending on how much longer you push yourself.

Would you like to:  
1. {Follow Tashigi as she enters the battlefield and confronts Crocodile's fallout.}  
2. {Jump to Luffy and Vivi reacting to Crocodile's reveal.}  
3. {Fade back to Eatone, waking up with a choice to make.}

>> USER: Option 2 

Meanwhile. I notice Tashigi, ever headstrong, rush off to stop Crocodile, somehow.

I wonder if she forgot that she said she'd give me a hand to the plaza. Oh well 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Wind Before the Storm]**  
**Scene: "Hope, Interrupted"**  
**Tone: Pressure Mounting | Mood: Fearless vs. Futile**

---

The **plaza churns**-steel against steel, civilians scrambling to safety, rebel soldiers turning their blades toward a king they no longer trust, and royal guards doing the same in kind.

But **the Straw Hats fight like anchors**-holding together the last frayed strands of truth in the storm.

And at the center-

**Vivi.**

Dust caked into her dress. Arms outstretched between rebels and guards, screaming herself hoarse above the roar of battle.

---

> "STOP IT! CROCODILE IS LYING TO ALL OF YOU!"

Her voice strains, breaks, and keeps going.

> "THIS ISN'T WHAT KOZHA WANTED! THIS ISN'T WHO WE ARE!"

---

But the crowd?

The crowd doesn't know who to believe anymore.

---

And overhead, **Crocodile's grin only widens**.

His cloak whips dramatically in the wind as he drags **King Cobra** closer to the roof's edge, displaying him like a marionette.

> "Touching, Princess. But I don't think they're listening anymore."

He lifts a hand-and **sand begins to swirl at his feet**.

> "So let's give them something they *can't ignore.*"

---

Suddenly-

> **"*CROCODILE!!*"**

A voice rings out across the plaza, full of steel and fury.

**Tashigi.**

---

She's standing on the opposite building, sword drawn, wind kicking at her coat.

> "You're under arrest, by order of the Marines-"

> "-and on behalf of *everyone you've hurt in this country.*"

---

Crocodile turns slowly to look at her, amused.

> "Oh. It's you. The little one with the glasses."

He lifts a finger.

> "Still swinging that toy around like it means something?"

---

**Tashigi doesn't flinch.**

Not when the sand hisses around her feet.

Not when the crowd below watches in stunned silence.

Not even when **Crocodile lifts his hand** and the first **spike of sand** forms beneath her.

---

> "This isn't for me," she says quietly.

Then louder-

> "*It's for them.*"

She leaps.

Sword gleaming.

---

**Scene Cut - Meanwhile...**

Back in the alley, **you groan softly**, shifting against the wall.

You heard the shout.

The name.

You smirk just slightly through the ache.

> "I guess she *did* forget about giving me a hand to the plaza..."

You close your eyes again for a second.

> "Oh well."

---

**OOC: Crocodile vs. Tashigi is beginning.  
Vivi is still in the plaza, on the edge of despair.  
Straw Hats are holding the crowd together.  
Eatone is recovering-**slowly**.  
But the stage is set.  
The next blow Crocodile lands might shatter the kingdom.**

Would you like to continue the **Tashigi vs. Crocodile** battle, shift to **Vivi's emotional breaking point**, or return to **Eatone preparing to rise again**?

>> USER: OOC: Crocodile outclasses all current allied combatants by a light-year. Because of that, he is likely to toy with them, rather than kill them outright 

Continue to Vivi's perspective

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Breaking Point of a Princess]**  
**Scene: "How Many Times Must I Fail?"**  
**Tone: Desperate | Mood: Fracture Beneath the Crown**

---

The noise is deafening.

Steel. Shouts. Gunfire. Explosions.

And **Vivi** is still screaming-

But it feels like she's underwater now.

Her words **don't carry** like they used to. Her voice cracks every few seconds.

Every time she thinks she's reached them-**the crowd shifts again.**

Someone throws a rock. Someone fires a shot. Another rebel charges blindly into a royal line, blaming them for everything.

The **truth** is buried under the **noise**.

---

And then she hears it:

> "CROCODILE!!"

**Tashigi's voice**, cutting across the plaza from above.

She looks up, eyes widening as she sees the duel unfolding on the rooftop.

---

Crocodile doesn't attack like a killer.

He attacks like a **cat playing with a mouse**.

He's not in a rush.

He knows he's already won.

---

**Tashigi swings.**  
A sand spike slams into her side, sending her skidding across the rooftop, coughing blood.

---

And Vivi?

She stumbles.

Almost falls.

---

> "No..."

She watches **King Cobra**, her father, strung up like a symbol.  
**Tashigi**, struck down in a single breath.  
The **rebels and guards**, driven to chaos by a lie she couldn't stop.

---

> "No, no, no..."

Her legs keep moving, even as her arms fall limply to her sides.  
She walks, zombie-like, through the crowd that no longer sees her.

---

> *Why won't they listen?*

> *Why wasn't the truth enough?*

> *How many more have to get hurt-because I failed?*

---

A stone strikes the ground near her foot.

Another guard pushes past her, yelling something about</pre>
