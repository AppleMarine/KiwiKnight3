<pre>g about vacation pay being taxed. What is it now?"

> "Enzo," you say quickly, stepping deeper into the alley for privacy, "Rain Dinners. Alabasta. Ever hear of it being a *death-trap?* I booked a 5-night stay."

There's a *long pause*.

You hear rustling paper. Then-rapid-fire shuffling.

> "Wait, Rain Dinners? Like... *the casino* Rain Dinners?"

> "Yeah, the one with the complimentary cocktails and Banana Gator show."

> "HOLY JUICEBOXES, *EATONE, GET OUTTA THERE!*"

The snail nearly bounces out of your palm.

> "Bro, I dunno if this is official intel or just smoke in the ranks, but I've heard some *serious crap* about that place. A couple of mid-level Baroque Works agents were intercepted near Loguetown two months ago. Talked in their sleep. Said Rain Dinners is a **front**. Like, whole operation-a warlord's nest or something."

> "Which warlord?"

> "That's the scary part-**they didn't say.** The officers clammed up after a Cipher Pol agent got involved."

You whistle low.

> "Listen, I can't file anything without getting demoted, but between you and me? **Pull out if you can.** Lay low, don't mention your Devil Fruit, and if anyone offers you a *banana cocktail with a funny aftertaste*, **run.** Oh-and one last thing."

There's a shuffling sound. He lowers his voice.

> "A Marine captain and a sword-girl went missing in that area a day ago. Unofficial. Not confirmed dead."

The line *clicks*-and Enzo's snail yawns, muttering, "Good luck, bro," before powering down.

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Proceed to check in to Rain Dinners-*but with maximum caution*. Activate all teacher instincts and keep your juice sense primed.}
2. {Rush to follow the group from earlier. If they're trying to take down Rain Dinners, they might be your best chance at survival.}
3. {Visit the kebab stand-play it off like a tourist, maybe gather more rumors from locals off the casino payroll.}
4. {Try to find the missing Marine duo. Head toward the dockside warehouses, where you suspect a hidden outpost could be.}
5. {Leave Rainbase. This vacation is officially cursed. Catch the next barge out. (*May result in XP loss due to unfinished arc*)}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 1 - I... Eh? What the hell is going on here? Rain Dinners has a 4.9 star rating on the World Economy News Paper! Why is everyone freaking out about it? Whatever, I'm getting my damn complimentary drink one way or the other. If I smell trouble, I'm riding a Kiwi-juice waterfall straight out the balcony.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected - "4.9 Stars? Then I'm cashing in."**  
**🎭 Social Stance: Alert Tourist | Inner Monologue: *"When in doubt, drink juice and stay near the exits."***  
**🍹 Goal: Check into Rain Dinners, claim complimentary drink, maintain tactical awareness**

**LOCATION SHIFT: Rain Dinners Main Lobby - Rainbase, Alabasta**  
**Time: Twilight, early evening | Weather: Dry, warm desert breeze | Atmosphere: Opulent, suspiciously sterile**

---

You step from alley to avenue, shaking the sand from your sandals like a man determined to enjoy **at least one damn perk** of his hard-earned summer break.

Rain Dinners looms ahead: a towering casino-temple of **gleaming glass and sun-bleached gold**, with neon crocs slowly rotating above the main gate like **guardians of gluttony**. Every brick of the place screams *luxury meets ominous cult headquarters*.

The glass doors open with a hiss of cool, artificially moist air. Your face is instantly hit by a **mist of fruit-scented humidity**-ironically, not kiwi.

> *Strike one.*

Inside, the **main lobby** sparkles with light. Dozens of **slot machines chime and ding** in hypnotic rhythm. **Tourists in floral shirts** clutch coin trays and spill drinks on velvet carpets. Above it all, a mural depicts **a heroic figure made of sand** holding a goblet aloft, with the words: *"RAIN DRAWS ALL FORTUNES TO SHORE."*

There are **no visible exits** except the way you came. Hmm.

A **uniformed hostess** approaches, wearing too much mascara and an unsettlingly wide smile.

> "Welcome, traveler! May I take your voucher?"

You hand it over, trying to look both casual and **ready to flip a juice-fueled backflip** if necessary.

She scans the slip, nods, and waves a **Banana Gator valet** forward-wearing a bowtie, naturally. It grabs your luggage (a single backpack with your sandals, baton, and backup worksheets) and hurries off. She hands you a small token marked **"COMPLIMENTARY DRINK - 1 USE ONLY."**

> "Please enjoy your time in Rain Dinners. We hope your fortune blooms in the desert winds~"

She bows and vanishes as fast as she came. Not weird at all.

---

**You are now inside: Rain Dinners - Main Floor**

🌟 *Current areas visible:*

- **Complimentary Bar Lounge**: A lavish, semi-circular bar with lounge seating and a jazz band playing faintly. There's a strange scent to the air-**a mix of perfumes and sea salt**, with a faint hint of... tranquilizer?  
- **Gaming Floor**: Rows of tables-blackjack, dice games, and some weird Alabastan variation of pachinko.  
- **Elevators to Guest Suites**: Guarded by stoic bouncers in white suits with **gold crocodile pins.**  
- **Banana Gator Aquarium**: A massive tank at the far wall-creatures slosh around in dim blue light, their eyes *very* intelligent.

**You feel watched. But not by any one person. The whole building feels like it's listening.**

You take a seat at the bar, token in hand. A bartender with a curled mustache approaches.

> "What's your poison, sir?"  
> "May I recommend the **Rain Delight**-banana-kiwi-coconut, with a *special touch* from the head chef?"

**Devil Fruit Passive Activated: Kiwi Juice-Olfactory Sensory Scan**  
*(Sniff test roll - Eatone's fruit instinct +1, cleverness +1 = Result: 3 [Good])*

Your nose twitches. Your senses hone in.

**That "Rain Delight" has a trace amount of seastone powder or sea prism ash-something subtle but potent.** Probably wouldn't kill you... but enough to weaken a Devil Fruit user like yourself.

You glance to your side. Two tourists are already sipping the drink. One is blinking slowly. The other... is snoring upright.

> *Strike two.*

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Accept the drink, pretend to sip, then discreetly dump it into a decorative vase. Play along, stay under the radar.}
2. {Ask for something off-menu. "Just kiwi juice, thanks." See how the bartender reacts.}
3. {Stand up, ask loudly: "Hey, anyone else feel dizzy, or is that just the banana funk in the air?" Risk drawing attention, but might spark a scene.}
4. {Excuse yourself and follow the Banana Gator valet. You want to keep eyes on your luggage and make sure your suite is secure.}
5. {Initiate escape plan: create a thin kiwi-juice waterfall along the floor near the bar, ready to activate at a moment's notice. Just in case.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}
