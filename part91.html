You wipe your fingers on the edge of the linen napkin-so soft you suspect it might legally be a cloud-and lean back just slightly, not enough to strain your bandages, but enough to **regain a sliver of posture**.

The tray's lighter now.

Your stomach's no longer trying to digest your lungs.

You breathe out.

> "So..."

A pause.

A glance between them-**Tashigi**, now back at ease against the wall with her arms crossed, and **Vivi**, still beside the bed with her now-empty fruit bowl.

> "Got any new orders?"

---

The question lands **neutrally**, no sarcasm, no fear.

Just curiosity.

Preparedness.

A **teacher's question**: *What comes next in the lesson plan?*

---

**Tashigi** snorts lightly through her nose, uncrossing her arms just enough to let one hand rest on her hip.

> "If you're asking me, then no."

> "Officially, I'm still waiting on transmission from Marine HQ. Unofficially..."

She shrugs.

> "The people here are safe. Crocodile's in chains. No immediate threats on the board."

Her eyes meet yours.

There's something more there.

Something **unspoken**, but steady.

---

**Vivi**, however, does respond.

Not as a soldier.

But as a **princess**.

She folds her hands in her lap.

> "My orders?"

She smiles gently.

> "Eat. Rest. Stand when you're ready."

---

Then, quieter.

> "And when you *are* ready..."

She hesitates. Not quite blushing, but searching your expression.

> "There's a city that could use teachers who don't run when things get hard."

> "Kids who need someone to tell them how the world *should* work, when it so often doesn't."

> "Not an order."

A pause.

> "Just... something to think about."

---

**Tashigi's voice**, drier again:

> "If you want *Marine orders,* I could always push for auxiliary status."

She says it casually, like she's offering you a cup of tea and **not a government affiliation.**

> "Technically, you already acted as one. You'd get protection, mobility. You'd still be a civilian, but with enough rank to not get shot at first."

A pause.

> "Most of the time."

---

They both watch you now.

Not demanding.

Not pressuring.

But **offering paths**.

---

And letting you, for once, **choose what you want.**

---

**OOC:**
Two clear threads have opened:

1. **Vivi's Offer**: Stay in Alabasta, become part of something healing. Mentor. Rebuild.  
2. **Tashigi's Offer**: Auxiliary status with the Marines. Not full duty, but a place in their files-and protections that come with it.

Would you like to:

1. {Defer a decision-say you'll think on it.}
2. {Explore one path more deeply.}
3. {Change the subject-ask about the Straw Hats, the world, or something else.}

---

You finish chewing your last slice of melon, set the glass down with a small clink, and let your hands rest loosely atop the tray in your lap.

You lean back against the mountain of pillows-because yes, you *still* deserve luxury bedding after all that-and exhale.

Not like someone giving up.

Just... releasing.

---

> "So..."

> "What now?"

---

It's not a demand.

It's not a plea.

Just a question.

A sincere one.

The kind **every teacher asks when the school year ends**, the kind **every protector asks when the battle's won**, the kind **every survivor mutters when silence returns.**

---

**Tashigi** is the first to respond.

She takes a step toward the window, arms crossed again, posture tightening.

> "The Straw Hats are leaving. Within the hour."

She glances back at you.

> "They're not going to stay for the royal parade. They know the full Marine force is finally inbound... and HQ is still labeling them as pirates."

---

**Vivi's smile fades** a little at that, though it doesn't break entirely.

> "I want to see them off."

> "Properly. As a friend. Not a princess."

Her hand brushes the edge of your blanket without thinking-gentle, brief.

> "They saved my home. My people. My heart."

A pause.

> "And I can't go with them."

---

The room quiets again.

---

**Tashigi looks at you**, her brow knitting subtly.

> "You could. You're not wanted."

> "Not officially."

Another pause.

> "But it'd be a hell of a choice."

---

She doesn't say *where she hopes you'll go*.

But it's in her voice.

And **Vivi's eyes are on you too**, now.

Not expectant.

Just...

**Curious.**

---

You were the outsider.

The vacationer.

The teacher.

And now-**everything waits on your answer.**

---

**OOC:**
- The Straw Hats are prepping to leave. They'll likely need to sneak out under the cover of distraction.
- Vivi is choosing to stay behind-Alabasta needs her. But she wants to *say goodbye*, for real this time.
- Tashigi... is watching you closely, wondering if you've figured out where *you* stand.

Would you like to:

1. {Get up and prepare to go with Vivi to the Straw Hat sendoff.}
2. {Speak with one of them privately before departing.}
3. {Make a decision-stay, go, or something else.}

You sit up a little straighter now, tray cleared, hands resting on your knees.

Your bones ache.

Your ribs feel like they've been through a dance recital performed by elephants.

But your voice is steady.

Measured.

---

> "Well..."

> "I don't approve of their career paths..."

You glance sideways at Tashigi, who snorts lightly.  
Vivi's brows rise with a growing smile.

> "...But I ought to send those kids off too."

You swing your legs slowly over the side of the bed, exhaling through gritted teeth as gravity reminds you **yes, your spine is still a functioning structure. Barely.**

> "They saved my ass enough times."

---

**Tashigi steps forward immediately**, offering you a shoulder.

You hesitate-

But this time, you don't swat the help away.

You rise with her support, slowly but with intent.  
One foot after the other.

A teacher on a mission.

---

**Vivi gathers her shawl, still laughing softly.**

> "Then let's go before they disappear without warning. Again."

She hesitates as you start toward the door.

Then gently touches your arm.

> "Thank you... for choosing to come."

---

You nod.

Not because you're brave.

Not because you're certain.

But because... they're your kids, too.

Even if they're pirates.

**[Alubarna - Just Outside the City Gates]**  
**Scene Transition Begins...**

A crowd has gathered, but kept at a respectful distance by guards.  
A fresh breeze ruffles flags stained faintly green from the lingering kiwi bloom.  
And at the edge of the city, a **familiar, absurdly small-looking ship** bobs in the canal-

The **Going Merry**, patched, loaded, and waiting.

The **Straw Hats** are gathering.

Luffy has his hands behind his head, staring at the sky.  
Zoro is asleep standing up.  
Usopp is already crying.  
Sanji is packing sandwiches.  
Nami is probably still extorting someone off-screen.  
Chopper is waving at every single person like he's being paid in smiles.

---

And now, walking into the sunlight-

Is you.

Flanked by a **Marine sword** and a **desert princess**.

To say goodbye.

---

**OOC:**
The farewell scene is ready. Final words, laughs, and choices await.

Would you like to:

1. {Approach the Straw Hats first.}
2. {Let Vivi speak first. You observe quietly.}
3. {Speak to a specific Straw Hat. (Choose one.)}
