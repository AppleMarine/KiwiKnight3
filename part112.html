<pre>s lazily from repaired chimneys, and **hope cautiously returns to its perch**.

And yet...

**You frown.**

It's not the rebuilding that nags at you.  
It's the silence.

> "Hey," you murmur, lowering your voice.

> "I know we captured Crocodile. Slammed him in enough citrus to pickle him for a week."

You glance sideways at her.

> "But what happened to the rest of Baroque Works?"

---

**Tashigi slows**, the wind tugging lightly at her coat. She doesn't answer right away.

You keep going.

> "I mean... Miss All Sunday? She disappeared in the chaos."

> "Mr. 1 and Miss Doublefinger were still fighting Zoro and Nami last I saw-do we know if they were *actually* apprehended?"

> "Mr. 2-Bon Clay-might have escaped in the confusion too."

> "And the agents at the Sandora River... Mr. 4, Miss Merry Christmas..."

You trail off.

> "We *won*. But we didn't *finish.*"

---

Tashigi nods grimly.

> "We know."

Her eyes narrow.

> "Miss All Sunday hasn't been sighted since Crocodile's capture. It's like she vanished with the wind."

> "Some say she was *never truly part of Baroque Works.* Just an opportunist."

You arch a brow.

> "Pretty powerful opportunist, for someone who read the Poneglyph like it was bedtime poetry."

---

She sighs.

> "As for the others..."

> "We've confirmed that some of Crocodile's officers escaped. Mr. 2's last known appearance was on the outer edge of Alubarna, near a civilian convoy. After that-gone."

> "No bodies. No arrests. Just empty footprints in the sand."

---

Her voice tightens-not with panic, but with something colder:

> "It's not over."

---

You look out over the city, watching a little boy chasing a lizard with a paintbrush, laughing as he misses every swing.

> "They're going to regroup."

Tashigi nods again.

> "They'll lie low. Regrow their masks. Build something smaller, smarter, meaner."

She looks at you fully.

> "Maybe not here. Maybe not soon. But somewhere."

---

A pause.

> "That's why we stay."

You nod, once.

**OOC: Here are the confirmed fates so far:**

- **Crocodile:** In Marine custody, imprisoned pending extradition to Impel Down.  
- **Miss All Sunday (Nico Robin):** Missing. Escaped during Crocodile's downfall.  
- **Mr. 1 & Miss Doublefinger:** Fate unclear. Possibly escaped in the confusion after the rebel battle.  
- **Mr. 2 (Bon Clay):** Escaped capture. Last seen aiding civilians-may not be hostile, but unpredictable.  
- **Mr. 4 & Miss Merry Christmas:** Unconfirmed. Their battle site was destroyed during the elemental eruption. Possibly buried, possibly gone.  
- **Lower Agents:** Several arrested. Many remain at large. Baroque's network was deep.

Would you like to:

1. {Request access to Baroque Works dossiers to investigate their structure-maybe help track them down?}  
2. {Plan with Tashigi to form a civilian task force-trained eyes in every quarter of Alubarna.}  
3. {Let it sit for now, and move forward with your day-there's enough to handle in the present.}

>> USER: ​Option 3 - I might need to need to learn how to keep Kiwi Kop active while I sleep. Wouldn't want to get my throat slit in bed by some vengeful Baroque boy or girl.

You lean against the worn stone ledge, arms crossed loosely as the shadows grow long across the city. The sun dips lower, dragging Alabarna into a golden hush. It's peaceful now.

*Too* peaceful.

---

> "You know," you mutter aloud, "I might need to figure out how to keep Kiwi-Kop active while I sleep."

Tashigi doesn't respond immediately.  
Just tilts her head slightly.

> "You expecting trouble?"

You scan the skyline.  
Watch two hawks wheel over the merchant district.  
Feel the ache in your ribs from the cannon blast that nearly turned you into pulp.  
Feel the still-fresh memory of **Baroque agents** slithering like ghosts beneath the foundation of a kingdom.

---

> "I'm not *expecting* it," you admit.  
> "But I've seen enough to know the world doesn't hand out happy endings."

You exhale, slow and measured.

> "Wouldn't take much. One bitter leftover with a blade and a grudge. I'm not hard to find. Hell, I filed paperwork under my real name."

Tashigi snorts softly.

> "You're dramatic."

---

You turn your head slightly.

> "You ever worry about it?"

She looks at you sharply.

You clarify.

> "When you sleep. When you're off-duty. That someone might try and finish the job they started?"

---

A beat.

> "Every night," she says.

---

That silence stretches again.

Not lonely.

Just honest.

---

You hold up your hand, conjuring a faint, humming orb of **juice-light**, swirling lazily in your palm like sap infused with the last breath of summer.

> "I think... maybe if I keep the elemental small. Less mass. Lower drain."

> "More of a warden. A lookout."

You glance at her.

> "Think I can train it to wake me if someone tries anything?"

---

Tashigi watches the juice swirl.

> "That's not a fruit technique."

> "That's a survival instinct."

> "And probably the most responsible damn idea I've heard today."

---

She pauses, then adds, almost offhand:

> "When you figure it out... show me. Might be useful for others like you."

She hesitates.

> "Like *us.*"

---

The silence after that?

Feels less haunted.

**OOC: You've unlocked a new personal goal:**

### **[Passive Summoning - Subconscious Kiwi Construct]**

> You may now begin experimenting with a small, low-energy elemental variant designed for **nighttime defense and alarm detection**.

Attributes may include:
- Limited lifespan (~2-4 hours unattended)  
- Heightened sensory awareness during your unconscious state  
- "Ping" alert upon perceived threat  
- Autonomous dissolve if attacked or overtaxed

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Begin working on a prototype tonight-experiment with fruit output before sleep.}  
2. {Head back to the palace and check in with Vivi before the day ends.}  
3. {Wrap patrol, grab dinner with Tashigi, decompress. Just a little.}

>> USER: ​Option 3 - You know any good kebab places? I was told of a few in Rainbase, but I never had the time to try them out. Because... Y'know.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Market District, Dusk]**  
**Scene: "Kebabs and Casualties"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Low Flame Warmth | Mood: Quiet Companionship, End-of-Day Softness**

---

> "You know any good kebab places?"

Your words break the long silence as you and Tashigi descend from the wall, boots tapping against sandstone steps smoothed by generations.

She raises an eyebrow.

> "Now?"

You give her a tired shrug, twirling your baton lazily over one shoulder.

> "I was told about a few back in Rainbase, but, uh... things got *complicated*."

> "Hard to critique spice balance when someone's trying to drop a warlord on your face."

---

Tashigi actually snorts. It's small, barely there, but it's real.

> "There's a spot near the artisan quarter," she says, motioning for you to follow as you turn down a narrow, cobbled side street. "It's old. Family-run. Still standing even after the siege."

> "The kind of place that doesn't *look* like much."

She glances sideways.

> "But then again... neither do you."

---

You bow exaggeratedly, nearly tripping on a loose brick.

> "I'll pretend that was a compliment."

**The alley opens up to a tucked-away stall**, half-lit by firelight and strung with makeshift lanterns. The scent hits you instantly:

**Charred lamb, sizzling spice, toasted cumin, fresh mint, and just a whisper of tangy yogurt.**

The grill sizzles behind a short man with a scar like a map across his face and a metal tong clenched in a hand that's probably seen battle. He gives Tashigi a subtle nod-like they've been here before. She responds with an equally subtle lean against the ordering counter.

> "The usual," she says.

> "And something f</pre>
