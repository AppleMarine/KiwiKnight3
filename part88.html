<pre>n... fancy afterlife limbo."

A beat.

> "Can I at least get a drink before the paperwork?"

---

There's a long silence.

Then-

**Tashigi** clears her throat, dry as desert wind.

> "You're not dead, Sensei."

---

**Vivi**, from the other side of the bed, struggles valiantly **not to laugh**-fails. She claps her hands over her mouth, shoulders shaking with giggles.

> "We *won*, actually."

> "You saved the country."

---

You lower your arm just a little.

Peer out.

See their amused, fond faces.

> "...Shit."

---

Tashigi crosses her arms.

> "You're in the palace. In a high-level recovery suite."

> "They said you earned the nicest bed. You also had a lot of fruit dumped on you, so, y'know. There's that."

---

Vivi finally composes herself, brushing her braid over one shoulder.

> "We've been watching over you all night."

She hesitates, then smiles.

> "You had a... lot of commentary in your sleep. Something about substitute teachers, and juice pressure valves."

---

Tashigi adds dryly:

> "And someone named Snack Pack."

---

You groan, trying to sit up, only for your muscles to groan louder.

Vivi instinctively reaches to steady you. Tashigi's hand hovers-**just in case**.

---

You're safe.

You're alive.

And for once-

You're not alone.

---

**OOC:**
- You've woken up. Fully lucid. Room secure.
- Vivi and Tashigi have kept vigil.
- You have the floor.

What do you say or do?

>> USER: ​Blink blearily. So... Everyone's safe? You two are safe?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing - Morning Light and Mumbled Worries]**  
**Scene: "Just Making Sure"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Soft | Mood: Sincere, Heartfelt, Gently Raw**

---

Your voice is cracked, dry, and just barely above a whisper.

But the weight behind it?

**Hits like a hammer.**

You blink through the haze of golden light, stare between the two women flanking your bed, and murmur:

> "So... everyone's safe?"

> "You two are safe?"

---

The air stills.

**Vivi's lips part**, and for the first time since you opened your eyes, her expression shifts-

From amused  
To tender.  
To deeply, quietly touched.

She nods once.

> "We're safe."

> "Thanks to you."

---

**Tashigi's gaze softens** just a fraction.

She doesn't smile-not quite-but her voice lowers to match yours.

> "All of us made it. No civilian deaths. No soldiers caught in the crossfire. Cobra's recovering."

> "The Straw Hats are still stuffing themselves sick."

She shifts slightly, then-

> "You kept your promise."

---

You breathe out slowly.

Let that sink in.

Let it wash over the aches and the bruises and the exhaustion.

You saved them.

---

For once, there's no punchline.  
No snark.  
No chaos.

Just two women watching you with **real, unwavering gratitude.**

Not for being a hero.

But for **choosing to be there** when it counted.

---

Vivi leans forward, resting her elbows gently on the edge of the bed.

> "You really thought we were dead, didn't you?"

You nod, just barely.

> "Would've made all of this feel a lot more permanent..."

---

She smiles sadly.

> "You didn't have to care that much."

---

**Tashigi** interjects, voice quiet but firm:

> "That's what makes it matter."

---

A long, shared silence.

---

The sunlight warms your face.

Somewhere outside, a camel honks.

The world is turning again.

And you're **here to feel it.**

---

**OOC:**
- You've confirmed what mattered most to you-that they're safe.
- Vivi and Tashigi now understand *how much* it mattered.
- You are free to speak, reflect, or ask anything now. You have the floor.

>> USER: ​Good. Lower my head. Good. Good good good.

I fulfilled my responsibility as an adult, nothing more

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing - The Things We Tell Ourselves]**  
**Scene: "Just a Teacher"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Grounded | Mood: Deflection, Acceptance, Quiet Admiration**

---

You sink back into the silken pillows, head gently lowering as if gravity itself finally grants you permission to let go.

Your lips part.

And all that comes out is:

> "Good."

A pause.

> "Good good good..."

---

The words spill like air from a leaking valve-pressure you didn't know you'd held.

They aren't triumphant.  
They aren't proud.  
They're **relieved**. Simple. Earnest.

Then-

> "I fulfilled my responsibility as an adult."

> "Nothing more."

---

There's another pause.

Not silence.

The kind of pause that feels full. Charged. Heavy.

---

**Vivi** draws in a slow breath.  
She brushes her thumb along a crease in your bedsheet, not looking at you at first.

> "Is that really all you think this was?"

---

**Tashigi** stays quiet, but crosses her arms.

And nods toward the window.

Outside, in the courtyard, a few children are **playing in puddles of juice** that still haven't fully dried, their laughter echoing faintly up to your room.

---

> "They're alive because of your ‘responsibility.'"

> "So is Vivi."

> "So am I."

---

**Vivi finally lifts her gaze**, eyes meeting yours.

There's no pity there.

Just... **something warm. Something a little sad.**

> "You didn't have to do anything."

> "That's what makes it heroic."

---

You feel it.

That tug in your chest.

Not pride. Not embarrassment.

Just...

**Weight.**

---

And yet still-some part of you insists:

> *"I'm just a schoolteacher."*

---

And maybe that's true.

But today?

That was enough to save a kingdom.

---

**OOC:**
- Vivi and Tashigi both see through your self-minimizing. But they don't push.
- They respect it. But they **don't agree**.
- The people you protected are alive. Because *you stayed*.

Would you like to:

1. {Stay with this scene - speak more with them.}  
2. {Scene skip - quiet breakfast. Just the three of you.}  
3. {Straw Hat farewell scene. Clock's ticking.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - How long was I out? Do your palace doctors take my insurance? 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing - Recovery Banter Begins]**  
**Scene: "Billing and Blood Loss"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Dry Humor | Mood: Gentle Recovery, Found Family Energy**

---

You shift on the pillows just slightly, your arm still heavy, your ribs still reminding you they were recently used as a cannonball buffer.

Your voice cracks like dry paper-but the edge of humor's there now.

That subtle deflection. That old teacher's reflex kicking back in.

> "How long was I out?"

A pause.

Then, as seriously as you can manage:

> "...And do your palace doctors take my insurance?"

---

**Tashigi** raises an eyebrow immediately.

> "Does your kingdom even have insurance?"

---

**Vivi**, sitting on the edge of the bed now, bursts into full, bright laughter. A kind you hadn't heard from her before the war.

> "You've been asleep almost three days."

> "Which means I've *technically* ruled longer than my father while a teacher was unconscious next to my throne room."

She winks.

> "Very prestigious."

---

**Tashigi** crosses her arms and adds, dryly:

> "You also drooled on royal linens."

> "Twice."

> "There's a scroll being drafted."

---

You groan into the pillow. Or try to. It ends up a half-hearted wheeze.

> "Great. I get a warlord on my resume and a cleaning bill from the crown."

---

Vivi chuckles, then leans forward, lowering her voice slightly.

> "Seriously, though... no one's charging you anything."

> "If anything, I'm about to write your name in the royal archives next to the generals."

---

**Tashigi** shifts a little, not quite looking at you as she adds:

> "And I'm pretty sure the Marines still think you're a fruit-slinging fugitive."

---

> "Cool cool cool," you murmur.  
> "So hero and outlaw. Same time. Love that for me."

---

They both smile at you now. Really smile.

The tension has faded.

For now-**you're not a stranger. Not a guest. Not even a civilian.**

You're **one of theirs**.

---

**OOC:**
- You've officially reentered the world-with sarcasm first, as is tradition.
- Vivi and Tashigi are firmly in your corner.
- The Straw Hats will likely depart soon-but your fate is yours</pre>
