<pre>a strange message: "May Fortune Bloom in the Dunes." (Might be code? Or just cheesy branding.)
- üçπ You still have your perfect daiquiri.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Leave the snack untouched and start quietly setting up juice-based traps in the room. Defensive prep.}
2. {Take a tiny, test bite of the snack. Just enough to sample. Roll for potential side effects.}
3. {Dump the cactus fruit in the balcony planter. See if anyone comes to check on it.}
4. {Pretend you ate the snack. Arrange the plate like you enjoyed it, then hide in the room and wait.}
5. {Use the time to try contacting Enzo (Marine contact) again-see if he can dig up anything about Room 703 or the phrase "Fortune Bloom in the Dunes."}

üåÄ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 2 - Also jam a stick or something in the window. I need to be able to exfiltrate through there in case there's some sort of remote lockdown.

>> ASSISTANT: **üé≤ Option 2 Selected - "Alright. Snack test first. Also let's not get trapped like a fool."**  
**üé≠ Tone: Cautious Curiosity + Subtle Prepper Paranoia**  
**üé≤ Bite Test - Sample the snack (Eatone +1 Careful, +1 Kiwi Juice Internal Resistance) = Result: 4 [Good]**  
**üé≤ Snack Effect Roll - ??? = Result: 3 [Neutral]**  
**üé≤ Prep Action - Window Jam Setup (Eatone +2 Clever +1 Resourcefulness) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**‚úÖ Outcome: You taste-test the snack safely *and* rig the window for a clean escape. The suite is now tactically secured.**

You stare at the cactus fruit for a long moment, swirling your daiquiri in one hand and gently flexing the fingers on the other. **Too perfect** a snack is always suspicious... but you're a man of reason. And curiosity.

> "Alright, let's see what the ‚ÄòCactus Deluxe' tastes like..."

You pull out your **travel spork**-never leave the island without it-and slice off a sliver of the fruit. It's... firm. Slightly sticky. The **chocolate smells real**, none of that fake Alabastan sugar-substitute crap. You rest the daiquiri nearby (juice defenses on standby) and take a very **measured** bite.

**Flavor Notes:**
- Tart, like prickly pear.
- Smooth chocolate melt.
- Subtle bitterness on the finish-something herbal, like aloe or crushed sea lavender.

> *Kiwi Juice sensors at rest. No toxin alert. Just... weirdly healthy for a casino treat.*

You wait thirty seconds.

**No burning. No dizziness. No hallucinations of dancing crocodiles.** Just... kind of a *refreshing zing*.

> *They really did just try to impress me with a fancy fruit dessert, huh?*

...Still weird that someone *handled it after delivery,* but the fruit itself seems clean.

Then, you get to work on something **far more important: escape engineering.**

You inspect the **window lock**-a vertical sliding pane with a gemstone-crusted handle. Beautiful, but flimsy.

From your pack, you retrieve a **wooden stirring stick** from the daiquiri tray and a **small pair of compact binder clips** from your teacher's kit. With a few deft motions, you:

- Jam the stick *inside the upper track*, preventing the window from fully sealing even under remote command.
- Use one clip to hold the window just slightly ajar-enough to let juice flow or allow a last-second dive.

Then, as a backup, you discreetly embed a **kiwi juice filament** around the sill-a living humidity sensor. If someone touches the window from outside, you'll know.

**üìù Tactical Status:**

- ‚úÖ Cactus snack: *Safe. Possibly symbolic. May contain mild stimulant herbs.*
- ‚úÖ Window: Now *exfil-ready* - will remain open even if lockdown is triggered.
- üîî Kiwi Juice Sensor embedded: alerts you to outside tampering.
- üõå Room: Currently secure. Lights dimmed to low. Curtains open, canal lights twinkling.

A soft breeze trickles in from the window. The desert air smells clean tonight.

But beneath that peace, you can feel it.

**This place is building toward something.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Wait in the suite. Hide near the door or balcony and see if anyone comes to "check on you." Could be revealing.}
2. {Head to the west docks now. You've confirmed your suite is safe. Time to chase Yazir's lead.}
3. {Try to find a service route or employee hallway. Something tells you the real secrets aren't on the guest floors.}
4. {See if you can make contact with Smoker. Now that you're stable, you might risk a private note or juice signal.}
5. {Look for your next bounty. Maybe there's someone in Rainbase tied to this mess-and worth tracking.}

üåÄ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Well, at least the suite's decent. Let's head back downstairs. Maybe play a few games. I hope they have strip poker (not).

OOC: Where are the relevant characters right now?

>> ASSISTANT: **üé≤ Option Selected - "Let's head back downstairs. Kill time, play a few games... definitely not strip poker."**  
**üé≠ Tone: Tourist Mode - Chill Exterior, Sharp Interior | Status: Returning to Casino Floor With Confidence**  
**üé≤ Mood Check - Eatone (Relaxed but Ready) = 3 [Fair]**

You down the last of your **award-winning daiquiri**, brush off your shirt, and head for the elevator. With the window secured and the snack confirmed *not poisoned*, your suite now feels more like a **safehouse** than a trap.

> "Decent room. Gonna be real mad if this place tries to kill me now."

The elevator descends slowly, a soft instrumental version of *Jungle P* playing through the speaker in what can only be described as "gondola elevator-core."  
Ding.

**You're back on the main floor. The air is thicker now-warmer, louder, and pulsing with a little more tension than earlier.**

**Before we proceed-here's a snapshot of relevant NPC positions as of now:**

### Casino Floor - Now

The floor's packed now: gamblers, dancers, dealers, and the soft croon of an Alabastan jazz trio fill the space. The smell of citrus-scented smoke and fried plantain lingers in th</pre>
