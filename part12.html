<pre>u've successfully blended in with the crowd  
- 🎧 Overheard during the race:  
  - "There's a *woman in blue* sneaking toward the loading docks-looked like royalty or something."

You spin on your heel, daiquiri in one hand, a pouch of crisp berri in the other, and slap palms with the first person you see-an elderly man in a frilly sun hat who's holding a fake crocodile tail as a good luck charm.

> "Let's gooooooo!"

He cackles in delight.

> "Snack Pack?! You madman, I *knew* someone else had the instincts!"

With the gator arena roaring, you confidently march up to the snail terminal and tap in:

> 💸 **Wager Confirmed: 300 Berri on Gator #3 - Snack Pack**  
> "Snack Pack's juiced up and ready for redemption."

The race begins almost immediately-announcer's voice screaming over the excited crowd:

> "AND THEY'RE OFF! LOOK AT THAT BEAST GO! SNACK PACK IS-IS HE BITING THE *OTHER* GATORS?!"

Indeed, Gator #3 is thrashing through the water like a **green missile** on a sugar bender. He launches past Goldfang, headbutts Munchie, and does a *frighteningly graceful barrel roll* around the final bend.

> "This is madness! This is illegal in three Blue Seas!"

Then-

**He surges forward. Hits the finish line. Leaves waves and a bitten floating saddle behind him.**

The crowd goes *bananas*.

> "AND IT'S SNACK PACK BY A SNOUT! BY A SNOUT!!"

The announcer slams his snail mic on the table and shouts toward the betting booths:

> "SOMEONE GET THAT GATOR A SPA."

Your terminal glows warmly.

> **"Congratulations, esteemed guest! Your 300 Berri bet on a 1st Place Finish has returned 1,200 Berri. Thank you for believing in Snack Pack™. Your payout will be delivered in gold-stamped token pouches shortly."**

Two **casino attendants** in crocodile vests approach and hand you a velvet pouch with **gold lettering**.

**Overheard nearby, during the roar of celebration:**

- **"Yo... who's that guy?"**  
- **"He's new. Real lucky. Cheng, I think. From the upper floors."**  
- **"Yeah, but that ain't just luck. That's *instinct.*"**  
- **"Watch him. If he wins again, alert the pit boss."**

And-

> "That woman's not a metaphor, idiot. She was in blue, with royal earrings. Looked like someone off the Wanted List... but prettier."

A nearby security guard glances at you briefly... then turns back toward his comm.

🌀 {Choose your action.}

> "A thousand. On Snack Pack."

Silence at the betting booth. The snail terminal almost *glitches*.

The attendant behind the kiosk lowers their sunglasses just enough to make awkward eye contact.

> "Uh... you sure?"

You just smile, casually toss your winning pouch on the counter, and press confirm.

> "That gator is my *spirit animal.* Ride or die."

The crowd around the Banana Gator RumbleDome has shifted-they're not just watching the race anymore.

They're watching **you.**

> "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE A REPEAT GAMBLER-THE HIGH ROLLER OF ROOM 703!  
SNACK PACK'S #1 FAN HAS RETURNED!!"

Spotlights sweep toward you as the arena announcer hypes the crowd. Gamblers throw up signs. Someone actually chants:

> "SNACK-PACK! SNACK-PACK! SNACK-PACK!"

You give a small, confident nod to your elderly high-five friend, who is now holding up two crocodile tails in salute.

**THE RACE:**

Snack Pack, now clearly vibrating with **too much banana gator rage** to be healthy, launches from the gate like a **sea cannonball**. He snaps at Goldfang's tail, flips Uncle Steve **onto the decorative sandbank**, and somehow **surfs on the wake** of another gator for a full quarter lap.

It's madness.

> "SNACK PACK IS A MONSTER!"  
> "IS HE FLOATING? HE'S FLOATING."  
> "SWEET MERCIFUL ROGER, HE'S *DOING A VICTORY TWIRL!*"

The crowd explodes. **Snack Pack wins. Again.**  
Not by a snout this time-by **half a lap.**

The announcer throws their boa into the stands and shouts:

> "I have *no idea* what's in that gator's veins, but someone get me a towel and a therapist!!"

**As the crowd erupts, two significant things happen:**

1. A **well-dressed pit boss** in gold-trimmed attire begins making his way toward you. Smiling. But **not smiling with his eyes.**

2. You catch the faintest movement near the **casino's side corridor**. A flash of **royal blue cloth**, followed by **a silver earring shaped like a royal crest.** The person vanishes down a restricted hallway.

> *Okay. Not a dancer.*

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Hold court. Accept the pit boss's attention and see what "congratulations" really means.}
2. {Slip away casually and follow the woman in blue. That wasn't a dancer. That was royalty.}
