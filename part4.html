<pre>desert sitcom!?"

He throws his arms up in a twirl and lets out a **shriek of giddy laughter**, staggering back and nearly knocking over a crate of glitter-bombs (which mercifully do *not* detonate). His guard drops like a sandbag off a camel cart.

> "Ohhhh I *like* you already, honeybun. No, I am *not* a parent. Probably couldn't hold a steady relationship long enough to raise a fish, let alone a child. But Clay would be a fabulous last name, wouldn't it? ‘Little Clay Junior, back from dance class!' Aww~"

He leans in again, a bit closer this time, but with genuine intrigue.

> "So what *is* a schoolteacher doing here in Croco-land, hmm? Don't tell me you're here to collect one of the *big bounties*... unless..."

His voice drops. His eyes flicker toward the direction the group vanished, just beyond a tall fence lined with tourist banners for "The Banana Gator Spectacular."

> "...unless you're tailing that group too. The ones with the antlers and the abs."

Bon Clay seems amused by you, and you've successfully **lowered his guard** for now. Your honesty reads as *so ridiculous*, it's completely believable. You've bought yourself some space to either dig for info-or slip away.

Your instincts tingle. Something in his tone... the way he said "Croco-land"... He might be bluffing about his role here. He's fishing. Hard.

**What do you do next?**

1. {Keep playing the honest tourist-teacher. Ask him what's going on in the city-especially about that group. See how far this act gets you.}
2. {Come clean: "Okay, part-time teacher, part-time bounty hunter. And I smell something fishy." Try to build a rapport based on shared weirdness.}
3. {Deflect completely: ask about *his* shoes, his outfit, or start talking about school dance recitals. Maybe make a friend out of this?}
4. {Politely excuse yourself, "gotta check on my travel companion," and try to catch up to the mysterious group.}
5. {Go bold: invite Bon Clay to lunch at the kebab stall you're now 20% sure exists. Who knows, maybe this weird man is a lead-or a future ally.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 2 - I hold up my printed-out confirmation for a 5-night stay at Rain Dinners. Sorry sir, I'm off the clock. Just here for pleasure. I saw that strange group sneaking around, wasn't sure if they were locals heading to a hidden hole-in-the-wall kebab shop, or criminals. Figured I'd make sure either way.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 2 Selected - "I'm off the clock. Just here for pleasure."**  
**🎭 Social Roll: Honest Confession + Mild Suspicion + Disarming Humor**  
**(Eatone's Roll: +2 Empathy +1 Rapport - Result: 5 [Great])**  
**(Bon Clay's Roll: -1 Distracted +3 Cunning - Result: 4 [Good])**  
**✅ Outcome: SUCCESS - Bon Clay opens up further, still suspicious, but charmed**

You pull out a slightly crumpled, sweat-dampened **paper voucher**, marked in bright pink ink:  
**"CONFIRMED - 5-NIGHT LUXURY PACKAGE, RAIN DINNERS. Includes: Welcome Cocktail, VIP Spa Soak, Complimentary Gator Show Seating."**

Bon Clay blinks.

You shrug, **offering a sheepish smile**, as if to say *"yeah, I came for the pool, not the politics."*

> "Sorry sir, I'm off the clock. Just here for pleasure. Saw that strange group sneaking around. Wasn't sure if they were heading to some hole-in-the-wall kebab shop or..."  
> "...you know. Criminals. Figured I'd make sure either way."

Bon Clay stares at you for a beat... and then laughs again, softer this time, more genuine.

> "Pfft-oh *bless your juicy heart!* You remind me of a desert bird with no sense of direction but a great sense of style. What are you, *Kiwi-scented with a badge?* Ha! You really *are* something else."

He folds his arms, eyeing the voucher like it's a contract to your soul.

> "Rain Dinners, huh? Well... funny you should mention that group. Because, get this: that little deer guy? *Not a costume.* And the one with the hat? Word on the grapevine is that he once punched a Sea King in the *gums.*"

He leans in, suddenly serious.

> "And you didn't hear this from me-but if you're planning to stay in that glitzy casino of deathtrap-y doom... watch your back."

A pause. His tone shifts. Dramatically.

> "*Things are going to get dramatic soon.* Rain Dinners isn't just a resort. It's the staging ground for the biggest heist, coup, or catastrophe this kingdom's seen in decades."

Then, with a wink and a flourish, he pulls a **folding fan** from seemingly nowhere, slaps it open, and waves himself down.

> "But what do *I* know? I'm just a lonely dancer looking for love and dessert in a war-torn country."  
> "...Also I *highly recommend* the curry gator kebabs down by the west docks. Not fancy, but *oof* the spice is to *die* for. Maybe I'll see you there~"

And with that, Bon Clay twirls on his heel, leaving a puff of glitter in the air, and flutters down the alley in the opposite direction of the group you'd spotted.

**📝 Info Gained:**

- Bon Clay recognizes the group as **dangerous outsiders**, specifically mentioning the "deer" and "hat-wearing one."
- He *knows* something is about to go down at Rain Dinners.
- He suspects you're not entirely what you appear to be-but he likes you.
- The **curry gator kebab stand** may actually be real (West Docks, open evenings).

**Time: Early Evening - Sun beginning to dip behind Rainbase's casino skyline**  
**Weather: Still hot, but cooling. Sand blowing lightly on wind currents. Tourists heading indoors.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Head back toward the main Rain Dinners entrance. Keep up the tourist act, check in to your room, and quietly scope the place.}
2. {Follow the mysterious group from a distance. You've confirmed they're no kebab-seekers. Time to see what they're really after.}
3. {Detour toward the west docks. Visit the kebab stand. Maybe someone there is worth talking to-or maybe Bon Clay left a message.}
4. {Contact a bounty hunter connection via Den Den Mushi. Get a pulse on local contract rumors around Rainbase.}
5. {Head to the Marine warehouse near the docks. You've heard whispers they have a secret outpost here-worth a poke?}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 4 - I... what? What's that about a death-trap? I thought Rain Dinners was family friendly! Call my good pal (A junior Marine officer) in my home-island's bounty office, and ask if he's heard anything about Rain Dinners.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 4 Selected - "What do you mean *death-trap*?!"**  
**📞 Contacting: Junior Marine Officer - Bounty Office, Your Home Island (Name: Enzo)**  
**🎭 Social Check - Casual Inquiry with Urgency (Eatone Rapport +2, Enzo's Loyalty +3) = Result: SUCCESS**

---

You stare down the alley Bon Clay vanished into, blinking like someone just told you your favorite juice brand funds pirates. You glance at your **Rain Dinners voucher** again, the glittery letters now reading more like a *warning label* than a promotion.

> *"I thought this place was family-friendly..."*

A single bead of sweat rolls down your cheek. It's not from the heat.

With a sigh, you slide your hand into your side satchel and pull out your **compact Den Den Mushi**, a smaller model commonly used by freelance bounty hunters on limited budgets. It twitches awake sleepily, little snail eyes blinking.

> "T'zzzt... Hello?"

You flip open your notebook to a folded page marked **‘Trustworthy Contacts - Marine Side'**, and tap the entry labeled:

**Lt. (Jr.) Enzo Bellamo - Bounty Office Liaison, North Bridge Precinct**  
**"Likes: Hot gossip, hates: being woken up before noon."**

You twist the dial. The Den Den's face morphs into **Enzo's sleepy-eyed snail likeness**, complete with oversized reading glasses and a half-eaten rice ball.

> **"Eatoooone?"** he slurs, voice half-asleep. "Bro, I told you last time: I can't do anythin</pre>
