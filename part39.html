<pre>rop on without bleeding.

Even Nami doesn't cut in.

**You have a window.**

You can say something sarcastic.  
Something heavy.  
Something kind.  
Or say nothing at all.

**What do you say or do?**

>> USER: â€‹Ey, better it happen to lil ol me than a nice girl like you. 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Rainbase Docks - Reconnection at the Edge of Escape]**  
**Tone: Quiet Comfort | Mood: Forgiveness in Disguise**  
**ðŸŽ¯ Emotional Outcome: You say just enough-and Tashigi hears everything you *didn't* say.**

---

> "Ey," you murmur, voice low, calm, with a tired smirk just barely tugging at the corner of your mouth.  
> "Better it happen to lil' ol' me than a nice girl like you."

Tashigi stares at you.

And for a moment... says nothing.

Then her jaw tightens-not in anger, not in indignation, but in a way that says your words **hit something she wasn't ready to show**.

Her hand flexes near her sword.  
But she doesn't reach for it.

Instead, she exhales hard through her nose-eyes misting just enough to betray what the rest of her posture is trying to hide.

> "Don't say things like that.  
Not like you're expendable.  
Not like *you're* not one of the nice ones."

She looks away sharply.  
It's the only way she can hold onto her Marine face.

> "You smell like juice and bad decisions, Cheng.  
But you did more than most officers would've."

Another pause.

> "Including me."

---

Vivi looks between the two of you with quiet warmth.

Zoro rolls his eyes with the faintest smirk. "We *done* emoting yet?"

Chopper wipes his eyes, then sneezes from the kiwi particles.

Nami shrugs. "Let them have their moment. He *did* save our lives."

Sanji lights a cigarette. "Guy's got style. I respect it."

Usopp starts scribbling in a notebook. "*The Legend of the Fruit-Fisted Phantom!*"

Luffy, from the ropes, raises one thumb into the air.

> "Good job, pineapple."

---

**You've made it. You're safe-for now.**  
Crocodile's trap has been **escaped.** The crew is regrouped.  
The ship is about to depart.

---

**What do you do next, bounty hunter?**  
Stay with them for the voyage?  
Slip away before the ship sails?  
Talk to Vivi or Tashigi again?

**The world is open. Your story continues.**

>> USER: â€‹I raise an eyebrow. Sooooo. Is this ship moving? Or are we waiting for Croc to eat us? Chop chop!

A pause 

Er, I am allowed onboard, right?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Rainbase Docks - Final Moments Before Departure]**  
**Tone: Dry Humor | Mood: Bittersweet Levity, Right on Time**  
**ðŸŽ¯ Outcome: You shatter the tension like a pro-again-and the crew? They *laugh*. You just earned your seat on this boat... whether you meant to or not.**

---

> "Sooooo," you say, looking around at the stunned, quiet group.  
> "Is this ship *moving* anytime soon, or are we waiting for Croc to come eat us?"

You give a wide, sweeping gesture to the docks, like a tired manager urging a lazy crew to clean up after a school field trip.

> "Chop chop."

There's a beat of silence.

Then **Nami snorts**.

**Zoro actually chuckles**-a dry, amused grunt like a man who's been through *enough* and respects a good exit line.

**Chopper is laughing outright.**  
"Don't say â€˜eat us,' that's bad luck!"

Even **Tashigi** exhales a sharp breath. It might even be a laugh. Maybe.

---

Then, just as the crew starts turning toward the ship's gangplank, you pause.

> "Er... I *am* allowed onboard, right?"

You raise your eyebrow just enough to make it awkward.

---

**Vivi** turns and answers first-without hesitation.

> "You saved our lives.  
You helped protect my kingdom.  
You *belong* with us. For as long as you're willing."

**Luffy** grins from the pile of rope and pulp.

> "You bring snacks?"

**Nami** sighs, already boarding.

> "Fine, fine. But if you drip on the deck, I'm docking your Beri."

**Zoro** shrugs. "Just stay out of the kitchen."

**Sanji**, from the loading ramp, nods. "Pineapple Man's got a room. One with airflow. He *needs* it."

**Tashigi**, stepping past you toward the ramp, pauses beside you for just a second.

> "You coming?"

She doesn't look at you.  
But you can hear the tension bleeding out of her voice now.

> "You're allowed."

---

And just like that-

**You're part of the escape.  
Part of the crew.  
Part of the story.**

---

**The ship creaks. The gangplank lifts.  
The wind shifts.  
And Alabasta begins to shrink behind you.**

For now.

---

**Do you board with a flourish, a joke, a quiet nod-or a promise?  
You control your entrance. This is your epilogue beat.**

>> USER: â€‹

>> USER: To the next arc - the race to Alubarna.

Cobra, finally getting proof of crocodile's machinations, leads an army to Rainbase to capture him, only to be captured himself. Bon Clay disguises as King Cobra has instigated a full on war. Rebel forces March towards the capital of Alubarna, led by Kohza, Vivi's childhood friend.

Vivi and the crew seek to get to Alubarna, crossing the Sandora river on an appropriated boat, to stop the conflict and reveal the nature of Crocodile's plans. Unfortunately, Baroque works are in hot pursuit. Crocodile seeks to get to the capital to find the poneglyph and end the war in his favor, with Miss All Sundays as his translator.

OOC: Changes from Canon - Smoker is still imprisoned. Luffy has not fought Crocodile yet. Robin did not revive Luffy after his first battle with Crocodile. Tashigi is now riding with the Straw Hats - for now.



>> ASSISTANT: **[NEXT ARC: The Race to Alubarna - War, Sand, and Secrets Beneath the Dunes]**  
**Tone: High Stakes Adventure | Theme: War on the Horizon, Truths in the Sand**

---

**Alabasta burns beneath the weight of lies and rising swords.**

The rebel army, fueled by falsehood and fury, **marches for Alubarna**, unknowingly pulled by strings wound around **Baroque Works'** gloved fingers.

At the heart of it all?

> **King Cobra: Captured. Impersonated.**  
> **Bon Clay**, wearing the King's face, fans the flames from within.  
> **Koza**, Vivi's once-dearest friend, now leads the rebels toward the capital-toward catastrophe.

The world sees civil war.

But beneath the sand, **Crocodile sees legacy. Power. Poneglyphs.**

---

**You**, Tashigi, and the Straw Hat crew have taken to the dunes-on a battered desert skiff that groans with every gust of wind and roars with every call to urgency.

- **Luffy** is still recovering, pale but stirring.
- **Zoro**, seated near the bow, sharpens a blade with one eye on the horizon.
- **Nami** squints at the makeshift sail, calculating wind speeds with swears and flair.
- **Vivi** stares ahead, toward Alubarna, toward a war she still hopes to stop.
- **Tashigi** rides close, one hand on her sword, the other gripping the ship's rail as sand rips past.

And you?

> You're at the stern-hair wind-whipped, coat still slightly citrus-scented, baton slung, eyes peeled behind your makeshift shades.

Your mission is unclear.

> You're not a Marine.  
> Not a Straw Hat.  
> Not Alabastan.

But you're here. Because you can't walk away when a city's about to burn.

---

**OOC: Canon has shifted significantly.**

- **Smoker is still imprisoned** in Rainbase, missing the opportunity to become a wild card.
- **Luffy has not yet fought Crocodile.** He is not battle-scarred or empowered by that confrontation.
- **Robin** has not interfered or helped the crew.  
- **Tashigi**, now alongside the Straw Hats, adds new moral weight-and **internal Marine conflict**.
- **Crocodile is ahead of the game**, having not yet suffered defeat or loss of control.

**You are an X-factor**-a man with the means and mindset to alter what comes next.

---

**What would you like to do now aboard the desert skiff?**

1. {Talk to Vivi-"You think Koza will listen to you? Even now?"}  
2. {Check on Luffy-"Hey. You gonna be able to swing that rubbery fist soon?"}  
3. {Strategize with Tashigi-"We need to plan for a three-front assault: Croc, the rebels, and Baroque Works."}  
4. {Scout with Zoro-"Any sign of pursuit? I've got juice le</pre>
