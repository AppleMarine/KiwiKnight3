<pre>ert heat and shadow, Vivi at the lead, eyes sharp beneath the grit.  
You take up a position just behind her and to the side-**close enough to shield, close enough to speak**.  
**Tashigi** flanks the opposite side, hand never straying far from her sword.

Your steps echo across cracked stone, the distant chaos of rebellion rising and falling like a tide.  
A **half-shouted order** from the guard. A **gunshot** from an unseen rooftop. A **wall collapsing** two blocks away.

But here-in this alley-it's tight. Quiet.

So you speak.

---

> "The Poneglyphs..."

Your voice is low. Cautious.

You glance at Tashigi, your tone like you're asking if a rumor is real-or if a horror story has teeth.

> "You think Crocodile can really... destroy the world? If he learns what's in them?"

---

**Tashigi doesn't answer right away.**

The two of you duck beneath a collapsed clothesline, following Vivi's sprinting shadow.

Then:

> "I don't know."

She doesn't say it like someone avoiding the truth.

She says it like someone who's thought about it **a lot**, and still has no satisfying answer.

---

> "The World Government thinks so."

> "They've silenced scholars. Raided islands. Imprisoned children. *Executed civilians*-just for getting too close to them."

Her jaw tightens as the two of you press into another turn-walls scrawled with rebel symbols and scorch marks.

> "And now Crocodile has one. Maybe more. Plus a woman who can read them."

---

She looks at you, and for the first time in hours, **she's the one asking the question.**

> "Wouldn't *you* be afraid of someone like that?"

---

A moment passes.

Then you hear **Vivi's voice up ahead**, sharp:

> "Two guards-Royal uniform. Injured. Just ahead."

You press forward.

**No rest. No answers. Just motion.**

But now... the weight of those stone tablets lingers in your chest.

---

**OOC: Your party is mid-traversal through Alubarna.  
You're low-power, but growing. Your juice ability is lightly regenerating.  
Poneglyph lore and moral weight now firmly in narrative focus.**

Would you like to continue banter, confront the injured guards, or let Vivi take point?

>> USER: OOC: All rebels, royal soldiers, civilians from this point forward may also be Baroque sleeper agents.

Continue moving down the alley with Tashigi, a grim look on my face. Observe the injured guards ahead.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Alley of Doubt]**  
**Scene: "The Masks Beneath the Sand"**  
**Tone: Suspicion Rising | Mood: Paranoia With Purpose**

---

The group slows, the alley narrowing into a crooked vein of rubble and heat.

**Two royal guards** lie slumped beside a shattered fruit cart:

- One is **clutching his thigh**, blood seeping through the gap in his armor.  
- The other is on his back, **breathing shallow**, his helmet cracked in two like a dropped melon.

Their uniforms are torn but recognizable. Blue and white. Dust-caked.

They groan weakly as your group approaches.

---

But you don't speed up.

You don't call out.

You just walk, slow and steady, **close to Tashigi**, eyes sharp behind that grim, teacher-no-more mask.

---

**OOC Note: From here on, all forces-**rebels, guards, civilians-**could be sleeper agents** from Baroque Works.  
Crocodile has a vested interest in keeping the war burning. The closer you get to ending it, the more he'll act to stop you.

---

Tashigi whispers without looking at you:

> "Those wounds are real."

> "But that doesn't mean their loyalty is."

---

You watch the "guards" as you pass:

- The one with the broken helmet has his **hand in his coat**.  
- The other's gaze flicks to Vivi's ringed hand, then quickly away.

---

Something's **off**.

You **can feel it** in your ribs.

---

Behind you, **Usopp** murmurs, "They're not calling for help."

**Nami:** "Not even looking shocked to see us."

---

Vivi slows as she nears them.

And the guard with the hand in his coat starts to move-

---

**You have less than a second to react.**

Do you:

1. {Launch a small burst of juice at the guard's hidden hand - nonlethal warning shot.}  
2. {Shove Vivi back and draw your baton. Go loud.}  
3. {Whisper to Tashigi: "Test them." Let her make the first move.}  
4. {Step in front of Vivi. Calm voice: "Don't move." Force the tension.}  
5. {Ignore them and keep walking. Call their bluff, and keep moving to your target.}

ðŸŒ€ What's your call, Sensei?

>> USER: Option 5 - we're on a tight timetable here, let's keep moving. But shouldn't they at least recognize their princess? That's... Concerning.

Shift my position in our group so I'm between Vivi and the guards.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Acknowledgment Denied]**  
**Scene: "Royalty in the Shadows"**  
**Tone: Quiet Alarm | Mood: Sand-Covered Deception**

---

You don't flinch.

You don't shout.

You just step-**purposefully, precisely**-between **Vivi** and the two downed "guards."

Your baton stays low.

Your eyes stay locked.

But your presence makes it clear: **Don't. Even. Try.**

---

> "We're on a tight timetable," you murmur, keeping your voice low for the group.  
> "Keep moving."

> "But..."

You glance again, a tight, almost imperceptible twitch in your brow.

> "Shouldn't they at least recognize their *princess*?"

---

They don't.

No salute.

No gasp.

Not even a flicker of deference.

Just... eyes that track movement like predators trying to remember which part of the herd to bite first.

---

**Tashigi notices it too.**

Her hand hovers over her sword, tension coiled through her entire frame.

But she says nothing. Not here. Not yet.

> "Concerning," she echoes.

---

**Vivi**, walking quietly now, doesn't look back at them.

Her jaw is tight.

> "They're not real guards."

> "Real guards would have bowed."

---

**Behind you**, as you move down the alley:

You hear nothing.

No cries.

No calls for help.

Only silence.

That silence follows you like a shadow.

---

**OOC Result:**  
- You chose to **not engage**, avoiding a possible trap.  
- **You are being followed.** Quietly. Stealthily. Likely sleeper agents waiting for a more vulnerable moment to strike.  
- Vivi is now **alerted** to the issue of impersonators. Her tension has increased.  
- Party cohesion remains intact.

---

Ahead, the **plaza walls** rise in the distance-the edge of the **First District**, where **Kohza** may be found.

You hear the distant crack of **gunfire** and **shouting**-not random anymore, but focused.

A **speech is happening**.

Someone's addressing the rebel troops.

**You're close.**

Do you:

1. {Break formation. Flank around to get a better view of the plaza and speech.}  
2. {Tell the group to slow down-prepare for ambush from behind.}  
3. {Keep moving at pace. Reach Kohza fast. Time matters.}  
4. {Speak to Vivi. This may be your last quiet moment before it all ignites.}  
5. {Signal Tashigi to peel back and deal with the "guards" following you.}

ðŸŒ€ Choose your next step.

>> USER: Option 5 - Shit... Crocodile might know about us now. Let's keep an eye on our tails, Tashigi-chan

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Tension Building in the Streets]**  
**Scene: "Eyes Behind Us"**  
**Tone: Quiet Strategy | Mood: Realization and Alertness**

---

You murmur to **Tashigi**, your voice low and edged with urgency.

> "Shit... Crocodile might know about us now."

You glance behind, the alley stretching out with shadows dancing around the corners. **Vivi**'s focused ahead, but the air has thickened around you.

> "Let's keep an eye on our tails, Tashigi-chan."

---

Tashigi nods sharply, her expression hardening, gaze snapping back over her shoulder as she instinctively reaches for her sword.

Her voice is barely a whisper.

> "Understood."

---

You **speed up** your pace, now more aware of the surroundings. It's like the air itself is thickening-**something** feels off.

---

**Vivi**, oblivious or perhaps keeping up the front for the group, doesn't say anything but her posture is different. **Tense**, like she's feeling the **same thing** you are.</pre>
