3. {"You go ahead. Let me watch our rear and cover this point." Prepare the fallback trap.}
4. {"If we're doing this, we're doing this smart." Draw a quick map with your juice. Navigate tactically.}
5. {"We should get her out too." Start talking plans to find Vivi. That's what started this, after all.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option X - You sure, ma'am? I've seen the newspapers, your CO's a beast. Whatever can take him down can probably turn me into pulp. Should we fall back and call for help? 

I gesture at her injuries with genuine concern

OOC: Out of concern for Smoker and her own pride/bravery, she might insist on continuing deeper.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option X Selected - "Are you sure? Because if *he's* down..."**  
**🎭 Tone: Earnest Concern, Calculated Caution | Focus: Protect the brave, not coddle them**  
**🎲 Emotional Intelligence Roll - (Eatone +2 Empathy, +1 Tactical Thinking) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Tashigi's Pride vs. Wisdom Roll - (+2 Duty, -1 Injury, -1 Trust in You) = Result: 2 [Average]**  
**✅ Outcome: Tashigi hears you-really hears you. She resists at first... but the weight of reality lands. She doesn't retreat, but she adapts.**

---

You fall into step beside her, close enough to speak low, your voice calm but firm.

> "You sure, ma'am?"

She halts, just slightly-barely a break in step-but enough.

> "I've read the newspapers. I've seen what your CO can do.  
The man's a beast. I've seen entire pirate crews surrender just because he *lit two cigars at once*."

You give her a look-not doubt, but genuine worry.

> "If *that* guy's been taken out by whatever's in here..."  
> "Then whoever did it could probably fold me into a lunchbox."

Your tone softens. You raise a hand, gesturing toward the blood on her temple.

> "And you're already hurt."

She breathes in sharply through her nose. You see it-the flinch. Not from pain, but from pride. From the *truth.*

> "I've had worse."

> "Not questioning your strength. I'm saying we might need to think bigger.  
Fall back. Regroup. Call in reinforcements. Marines. Hunters. Hell, a Weather Priest from Skypeia if we can get one on short notice."

That gets a faint snort-half a chuckle, half a sigh.

> "Smoker would never retreat," she says.  
Then, quieter:  
> "...But he would *think.*"

She steps back toward the wall, leans slightly, touching her head again.

> "I won't run, Cheng. But you're right. Charging in blind is a good way to make this a recovery mission instead of a rescue."

She pulls out a small, black-bound notebook from her inner coat and flips to a sketched floor plan.

> "This is what I have on Rain Dinners' internal layout. Incomplete.  
If we're going in, we're going **around**-not through. Take a service tunnel to flank the lower levels where the cage system is kept."

She draws a line with a pencil.  
**A longer path. Safer. Smarter.**

She glances at you.

> "Will you take point?"

---

**📝 Tactical Update:**

- Tashigi acknowledges the danger. She will not fall back fully, but will take the **longer, stealthier route**.
- You've preserved her pride while shifting the operation to a safer plan.
- You are now leading the approach. She defers to your instincts until reinforcements arrive (or don't).

---

**Next Decision:**

1. {Accept point. Guide her through the flank route. Prep juice traps and markers as you go.}
2. {Suggest splitting up. One of you draws fire, the other circles. Risky, but could gain advantage.}
3. {Insist on treating her injuries with first aid before moving. You've got a little medical training.}
4. {Map your own juice-route in parallel. If all else fails, you can carve an exit with it.}
5. {Ask her more about Rain Dinners' internal cage system. You need to know *exactly* what you're walking into.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: ​Option 3 - Consider me part of your posse, ma'am.

I rip a piece of exquisite cloth off the downed assassin. Before we go, mind if I take a look at those wounds? Don't want you getting an infection later (in a teacher's tone of voice)

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 3 Selected - "Consider me part of your posse, ma'am."**  
**Action: First Aid via Improvised Materials | Tone: Responsible Adult Energy**  
**🎲 Medical Roll - (Eatone +1 Basic Field Training, +1 Resourcefulness, +1 Teacher Authority Voice) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**🎲 Tashigi's Resistance to Being Cared For - (+2 Pride, -2 Respect for You and the Facts) = Result: 0 [Mediocre]**  
**✅ Outcome: She grumbles, but lets you tend her wounds. You stabilize her condition and earn deeper trust.**

---

You tuck your baton away, kneel beside the downed assassin, and without hesitation, rip a **clean swatch of silk** from the hem of his overdesigned Baroque Works jacket. It's absurdly luxurious-threaded with gold, probably worth more than your **entire monthly salary** back home.

You twirl it once to test the fibers, then fold it into a **makeshift compress**, your expression all business.

> "Consider me part of your posse, ma'am," you say, standing again.  
> "But before we play heroes in some underground death-maze-mind if I take a look at those wounds?"

She opens her mouth-probably to object-so you *cut her off with tone alone.*

> "Because if that cut festers and you keel over from a fever in three days,  
*I* am not doing the paperwork."

She raises an eyebrow. Then sighs like a woman who's been assigned *extra homework she can't argue with.*

> "...Fine. Just don't make a big thing out of it."

You step in gently, motioning for her to tilt her head.

**The damage:**

- A clean cut along her right brow, bleeding slowed.  
- Minor concussion signs-likely from the impact during her earlier fight.  
- Nothing life-threatening, but **infection risk is real** in an environment like this.

You dab the wound with a **kiwi-acid-diluted cloth tip**-*low concentration*, just enough to cleanse without burning. She winces, but doesn't flinch.

> "You're better at this than half the field medics I know," she mutters.

> "I grade science fair disasters for a living," you reply. "This is nothing."

You tie the silk into a tight head wrap, neat and snug. It looks ridiculous. Also kind of badass.

> "There. You're stabilized. Not dying. No excuse to stop moving."

> "Understood, Nurse Cheng," she deadpans-but you catch the smallest smile at the corner of her mouth.

---

**📝 Status Update:**

- Tashigi is now **treated for infection** and stabilized.  
- Her concussion symptoms have been **partially addressed**-enough to stay alert.  
- Your standing with her has deepened. She sees you not just as backup-but as *reliable.*

---

**Inventory Note:**
- **-1 square meter of Baroque Luxury Silk** (Used)  
- **+1 Kiwi-Acid Cleanser, Improvised (Field Use)**

---

She nods toward the deeper tunnel.

> "Alright. Let's go save your blue-haired mystery girl, and maybe catch a Warlord committing treason while we're at it."

---

**Next Move:**

1. {Lead the way into the flanking tunnel, juice-sensing ahead for traps or movement.}
2. {Mark a fallback zone with juice on the floor behind you-just in case the whole tunnel caves in.}
3. {Suggest leaving a trail Tashigi can follow if you need to split temporarily. Prep for split maneuver.}
4. {Ask her what intel she has on the trap mechanism Crocodile's supposed to use. Details could save lives.}
5. {Sneak ahead solo for 30 meters-give her time to fully recover while you scout.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option X - Rational cowardice

​I choke on my spit.

Wait, whoa whoa whoa. WHOA.

Warlord? I thought this was just some low level organized crime? What warlord?

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option X Selected - "WHOA. Back up. *Warlord?*"**  
**Tone: Rational Cowardice with a Splash of Panic | Status: Shocked Teacher Realizing the Final Boss is Real**  
**🎲 Reaction Performance Roll - (Eatone +2 Earnestness, +1 Startled Humor, +1 You've Been Cool So Far) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Tashigi's Response - (+2 Respect for Honesty</pre>
