Would you like to:

1. {Try to offer a theory to the crew-how to hurt Crocodile.}  
2. {Push Kohza and Vivi to take control of the crowd.}  
3. {Keep observing, narratively positioning yourself to reenter in a support role.}

>> USER: Option 2 - C'mon, blue. Rubber boy's buying you time. Do something.

Look around for Tashigi

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Moment to Lead]**  
**Scene: "Her Kingdom, Her Voice"**  
**Tone: Urgent | Mood: Breath Held Across a Nation**

---

You shift on your side, everything aching, every breath a negotiation between pain and consciousness.

But you're watching her-**Vivi**-and you can see it.

She's standing there.

Beside **Kohza**.

Crowd **silent**.

All the pieces are finally aligned.

And she's **frozen**.

---

So you speak.

Your voice is dry and broken, but it **cuts** through the moment like chalk on a blackboard.

> "C'mon, Blue..."

> "Rubber boy's buying you time."

A wheeze.

> "So do something."

---

She turns to look at you, the world tilting in her eyes.

---

You glance around instinctively-**looking for Tashigi.**

And from your spot on the ground, you **spot her**:

Slumped at the rooftop edge. One hand gripping stone. **Alive.** Bloody. Watching.

She sees you see her.

And gives you the **smallest nod** of confirmation.

She's out of the fight.

But **she's here.**

---

Back below, **Vivi breathes in.**

A deep, trembling breath.

She steps forward, slightly past Kohza, who meets her glance-and nods.

---

She raises her hands.

Not in surrender.

But to speak.

---

> "Everyone... **listen to me!**"

Her voice shakes at first, then **steadies**.

> "You've all seen it. The fighting. The lies. The people who tried to kill me in my own streets-**dressed as guards!**"

> "You've heard the rumors, the drought, the rebellion-**you've bled for this country**..."

> "And *so have I!*"

She pulls her cloak aside, revealing the slashes across her arm and shoulder.

---

> "But the truth is this: **the enemy was never each other.**"

> "The enemy is a man who thinks kingdoms are things to break open. Who thinks he can take power from under our palace without ever once earning the right to lead."

---

She points skyward.

At the swirling **sandstorm**.

At the shape of **Crocodile**, toying with a boy made of rubber and will.

> "The enemy is *up there.*"

---

Silence.

Then:

> "...She's right," Kohza says, stepping beside her.

> "The fighting stops. **Now.**"

---

And the crowd... **listens.**

Swords lower.

Banners are dropped.

Someone begins to kneel.

Then more.

---

**The war is ending.**

**Right here.**

Right now.

Because **she said so.**

---

**OOC:**
- Vivi has rallied the crowd. The rebellion has officially ceased.  
- Kohza has lent his authority.  
- Crocodile may or may not be aware of the power shift below.  
- Tashigi is alive, still unable to act.  
- You are still conscious-but on the edge.  

Would you like to:
1. {Push yourself to get a message to Luffy-about Crocodile's weakness.}  
2. {Just rest. You've done enough. The next move is theirs.}  
3. {Call out to Tashigi-if she can move, now's the time.}

>> USER: Option X - Lowly remark that even if the war is stopped, there's still the crocodile sized issue in the room to deal with. An issue that's seems to be growing, as Crocodile seems to be growing bored of Luffy 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Calm Before the Sandfall]**  
**Scene: "The Crocodile-Sized Problem"**  
**Tone: Exhausted Realism | Mood: Victory Tainted by What Still Looms**

---

The plaza has stilled.

For the first time since this morning, there is **no shouting**.

No swords clashing. No false flags. No panic.

Only the sound of **wind** whipping across the rooftops.

And the low crackle of **sand building above**.

---

You lie there-juice barely flowing, lungs ragged-and despite the overwhelming relief all around you, **you don't smile.**

Not yet.

You murmur to no one in particular, maybe Vivi, maybe the ground.

> "Even if the war's stopped..."

You swallow hard.

> "There's still the *Crocodile-sized* issue in the room."

You glance up toward the **rooftop**, where **Luffy is breathing heavy**, clothes torn, sand clinging to his limbs. His **fists are cracked** from the impacts.

**Crocodile?**

**Barely touched.**

---

You watch Luffy **launch another punch**-  
> "Gomu Gomu no Pistol!"

**Crocodile simply parts** into a cloud of sand. Again.

He yawns.

Literally.

---

> "Is that it?" Crocodile says, spinning a tendril of sand around his finger like a bored lecturer with chalk.  
> "Your grand pirate dream riding on this? I expected more from a future corpse."

He slams a hand into the rooftop, and a **wave of dehydration** spreads across the stone, turning tiles to **dust** beneath Luffy's feet.

---

Luffy stumbles.

He's running out of time.

---

Your voice rasps out again.

> "He's getting bored."

You cough into your sleeve, something wet and red sticking to your palm.

> "That's when he gets dangerous."

---

From her rooftop perch, **Tashigi's fingers twitch**, her eyes narrowing. She sees it too.

From the plaza, **Vivi looks up**, her joy dimming at the sight.

From beside her, **Kohza's fists clench.**

---

And around you... the people **watch.**

The rebellion may have ended.

But the **true war** still rages above.

---

**OOC:**
- Crocodile is now entering **second phase**: no longer toying. Luffy is at critical stamina.  
- Crowd is rallying behind Vivi-but helpless against a Warlord.  
- You are too weak to fight-but **not too weak to speak**.

Would you like to:

1. {Speak up: offer the crew the clue to how Luffy can hurt him.}  
2. {Signal Tashigi-pass the torch of action to her, if she can move.}  
3. {Try to conjure a final glob of golden kiwi-wet enough to be... useful?}

>> USER: Option X - Observe with trepidation.

Meanwhile, an angry cloud of smoke of captain rank may or may not be entering the airspace

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - Storms Above, Smoldering Below]**  
**Scene: "The Tide Is Still Turning"**  
**Tone: Suspense Building | Mood: Watching the Scales Wobble**

---

You don't move.

You **can't**.

But you **watch.**  
Eyes heavy, heart pounding like a kettle drum someone's spilled a war on.

**Luffy** is staggering now.  
**Crocodile's** grin is wider. Lazier.

Like a predator deciding whether to eat or just savor the taste of fear a little longer.

The rooftop crumbles beneath the dehydration.  
Stone to sand.  
Foundation to nothing.

> *He's not just fighting the boy now,* you think.

> *He's erasing the building from under him.*

---

**Below**, the people stir uneasily. The rebellion's flame has been doused, but the **weight of helplessness** presses down.

Vivi's shoulders are rigid again. Her fists clenched so tightly her knuckles glow white.

---

Tashigi, still sprawled across the palace's lower ledge, tries to push herself up on a trembling elbow-

But stops.

**Even her sword wouldn't reach him now.**

---

Your gaze flicks to the horizon.

**Something's changing.**

There-along the eastern edge of the city skyline-  
the faintest, strangest *wisp* of white.

Not a cloud.

Not smoke from the battle.

> *It's cleaner. Thicker. Angrier.*

It moves **against the wind.**

---

You recognize it.

A **roiling, fuming, cursing** sort of trail.

One that's punched through buildings and bureaucracy alike.

> *No way...*

---

Somewhere far above, in the rapidly crowding skies-

A voice made of gravel and hatred rasps through gritted teeth.

> "You're going to pay for laying a hand on my subordinate."

---

**Smoker has entered Alubarna airspace.**

And he's not smiling.

---

**OOC:**
- You are observing Crocodile's dominance.  
- Luffy is near the edge of a tactical defeat-first encounter still mimicking canon.  
- Smoker, finally freed (by Robin? By delay timer?), is now approaching the battlefield.

You are the only one who's noticed the smoke.

Would you like to:
