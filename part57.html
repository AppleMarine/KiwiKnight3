<pre>tted teeth, the puffed chest, the furious loyalty trying to dress itself in anger-

And the sheer exhaustion under it all.

---

> "Welcome back, Teach," she says, using the title **deliberately**.  
> "Try not to pass out again until we're done saving the country."

She turns back around-her sword resting across her lap, eyes already scanning the city walls of **Alubarna**, now looming near enough to smell the heat in the bricks.

---

You slump again.

> *No respect.  
Not even from the Marines.*

But you're back.

Alive.

And the final test is coming.

---

**OOC: You are fully conscious, and in the final leg before Alubarna.  
Vivi and Tashigi are riding near.  
Straw Hats are nearby.  
Camaraderie is high.  
War is imminent.**

Would you like to make one last remark? Prepare? Or ride silently to the gates of war?

>> USER: I gesture to Tashigi. 

Please. Please. PPLEEEASE tell me that you're not the only Marine backup we've got. 

OOC: communications across the country have been degraded. Vivi used a messenger hawk back in Rainbase to call for the ducks

>> ASSISTANT: **[Desert Crossing - Final Approach to Alubarna]**  
**Scene: "The Last Line of Defense is a Substitute Teacher"**  
**Tone: Gallows Humor | Mood: If You Don't Laugh, You'll Scream**

---

You half-lift your arm and gesture toward **Tashigi**, still trying to sit like your organs aren't playing musical chairs inside your ribcage.

> "Please. Please. *PPLEEEASE* tell me that you're not the *only* Marine backup we've got."

Your voice cracks in all the wrong ways-exhaustion, disbelief, existential despair.  
You sound like a man who just realized he might be on the final level of the test and forgot his study notes.

---

**Tashigi** glances over her shoulder again, the ends of her short hair fluttering in the dry wind.  
She doesn't smile. Not this time.

Just a slight, sharp exhale through her nose.

> "Smoker and I were the only ranking officers in Alabasta."

> "He's still trapped in Rainbase. And... communication's down."

---

She nods at the sky, where the blue expanse holds only heat haze and vultures.

> "Radio's worthless. Den Den mushi signals are choked across half the kingdom. Baroque's work, we think. Civilians can't even evacuate properly."

---

She looks back ahead at the rising stone walls of **Alubarna**, distant but huge. You can already see the palace tower gleaming in the sun.

> "As of now... it's us."

---

A pause.

Then she adds:

> "A pirate crew, a substitute teacher, a wanted princess, a deer doctor, and a bunch of ducks."

You stare.

Blink.

> "We are *so* dead."

---

Behind you, **Luffy grins like someone who just got handed the world's biggest playground.**

> "Sounds fun!"

---

**OOC Context Check:**

- The **Marine command structure** in Alabasta is disrupted.  
- You are **cut off** from larger World Government support.  
- Communications are degraded.  
- It is *just* the Straw Hats, Vivi, Tashigi... and you.

And now you're **minutes from the city gates.**

---

**What do you do?**

1. {Try to strategize with Tashigi. Someone has to play the adult here.}  
2. {Turn to Vivi. "You've got a plan, right? You're royalty. Please tell me you have a plan."}  
3. {Groan. "I should've taken that job in the West Blue."}  
4. {Say nothing. Focus. You've bled for this long. Might as well see it through.}  
5. {Make peace with the ducks. They're the real MVPs.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 4 - they're not pirates or princesses to me, I say softly. They're children. 

I glance at Vivi sadly.

Why does hope have to rest on their shoulders?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Approach to Alubarna - The Weight on Young Shoulders]**  
**Scene: "The Adult in the Room"**  
**Tone: Heavy Reflection | Mood: Bittersweet Resolve**

---

You slump forward slightly, feeling the wind tug at your collar, the dry heat pressing into your bandages.  
But your voice, when it comes, is steady.

Soft.

> "They're not pirates or princesses to me."

You glance toward the ducks ahead-**Luffy's laughter**, **Usopp's bragging**, **Chopper's giddy bounce** as he rides with Sanji, pretending he's not scared.

Then your eyes land on **Vivi**, her shoulders drawn but face forward, eyes sharp despite everything she's lost.

---

> "They're children."

---

The desert seems to quiet around the words.

**Tashigi's head turns slowly.** She doesn't interrupt.  
**Vivi**, riding in silence beside you, doesn't respond at first.

---

You look at her.

The fatigue behind your eyes is old, the kind worn by those who've kept smiling because **someone had to.**

> "Why does hope have to rest on their shoulders?"

---

Vivi doesn't look at you.

Not right away.

But her jaw tenses. Her hand tightens on the reins.

---

Then softly:

> "Because the ones who were supposed to protect them..."

She trails off.

You both know how the sentence ends.

---

The wind kicks up a little dust. The great **gates of Alubarna** loom ahead now-stone and steel, banners flapping from the towers in silent warning. The sound of distant **marching** is just barely audible over the wind.

---

Vivi finally speaks again.

> "They're not just children."

> "They're my friends."

She glances at you now.

Eyes full of grief. And fire.

> "And if they're willing to fight for my country... then I will, too."

---

**Tashigi**, overhearing, gives a slight nod from her duck, but says nothing.

The silence between the three of you isn't cold.

It's something heavier.

Something like... **understanding.**

---

The **city gates are now in view.  
The last stretch of sand lies before you.**

Would you like to say more? Or ride silently into the capital?

>> USER: Pat Vivi's shoulder. I guess I can't back out now. No responsible adult would let you run into the fire alone. I grunt, sitting up. I still feel juiced out, combat ineffective.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Gates - Crossing the Threshold]**  
**Scene: "No Going Back"**  
**Tone: Steady Commitment | Mood: Wounded, But Willing**

---

You shift in the saddle with a groan, every muscle screaming protest, every cracked rib chiming in like the world's most sarcastic orchestra.

But you reach out anyway-**slowly**, hand trembling from fatigue-and pat **Vivi's shoulder.**

It's not dramatic.  
It's not heroic.  
It's just... *solid.*

---

> "I guess I can't back out now."

Your voice is rough. Dry. But it doesn't shake.

> "No responsible adult would let you run into the fire alone."

You grunt, sitting up straighter, posture rigid despite the throb in your spine and the fact that Cruller the duck visibly winces beneath your weight.

> "Still feel juiced out," you mutter. "Combat ineffective."

A pause.

> "But I've got a baton. And righteous indignation."

---

**Vivi looks at you**, silent at first.

Then, she leans slightly-just enough for her uninjured arm to brush against yours.

> "That's more than most kings bring to the table."

---

Ahead, the city gates of **Alubarna** begin to creak open.

Smoke coils above rooftops.

The thunder of boots grows clearer.

Somewhere-hidden in its heart-Crocodile is moving the final pieces.

And you?

You're going in.

Broken.

Unarmed.

Exhausted.

> But *not* backing out.

---

**OOC: You are now entering Alubarna.**  
**Combat readiness: Low**  
**Resolve: High**  
**Support role assumed.**

Would you like to fade into the arrival scene... or keep the banter going as the gates open?

>> USER: So, blue. Mind telling me why you seem to be running a one princess crusade against Crocodile? (Ask for her backstory)

>> ASSISTANT: **[Entering Alubarna - Truth at the Gates]**  
**Scene: "Why Me?"**  
**Tone: Honest Curiosity | Mood: The Teacher Asks the Hard Question**

---

The city gates of **Alubarna** begin to open slowly before you, the mechanisms clanking like ancient chains being pulled from the belly of the desert itself.

Tension hums through the air like a coiled wire. You feel it in your spine, your teeth, your knees.

But now-on the cus</pre>
