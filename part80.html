> "You're one of the bravest damn people I've ever met. You *choose* to stand between monsters and children."

> "And I'm not letting you die in my arms like some... *idiot martyr with a pillow kink!*"

---

**Vivi**, eyes wide and glassy, stares down at you, lips trembling.

> "We're not just losing a fighter..."

> "We're losing our *sensei.*"

---

Above-

Crocodile's arm comes down.

---

> "*Goodbye.*"

**OOC:**

You've now been reached with:

- **Personal confessions of belief.**  
- **Emotional vulnerability.**  
- **A call to your identity.**  
- **A surprisingly accurate accusation of unconscious thigh-napping.**

Your next heartbeat may determine whether **Alubarna survives this moment.**

Would you like to:

1. {Whisper. Stir. Call. Something.}  
2. {Let the Elemental respond on its own.}  
3. {Stay still. Leave it to fate.}

>> USER: Frown as I'm shaken, lamenting the loss of my deluxe pillow.

Ugh... Are you rain dinners staff? Could you bring another pillow 

My eyes creak open, then see Tashigi's flustered, desperate face as she shakes me like a maraca, and then at the growing sand projectile forming in the sky.

Wuhh... Oh SHIT.

OOC: What are their reactions?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Reawakening of the Kiwi King]**  
**Scene: "Awakening from the Worst Possible Nap"**  
**Tone: Whiplash | Mood: Relief So Sharp It Hurts**

---

> *"Ugh... Are you Rain Dinners staff? Could you bring another pillow-"*

That's the first thing out of your mouth.

Half-mumbled.

Completely nonsense.

Tashigi and Vivi freeze.

---

**Tashigi's eyes snap wide open.**  
Her mouth moves in silent disbelief.  
The first instinct is to slap you again, but her hand stops halfway.

> "You *idiot,* you're-?!"

Then you *really* look around.

You register her flushed, furious, tear-lined face.

You see Vivi clinging to your arm like a lifeline.

You see the **massive sand spear** descending from the sky like **God's own guillotine**.

And then-

> "Wuhh... Oh SHIT."

---

**Tashigi just screams:**

> "*WELCOME BACK!!*"

---

**Vivi gasps-then laughs. It bursts out of her like a gasp of air after drowning.**

> "He's *awake!*"

She doesn't cry.

Not quite.

But she's suddenly wiping her eyes like it's the sand.

---

All around, people **hear you**-your voice carrying up with the wind.

**Luffy's head jerks around.**

**Crocodile's spear hesitates.**

He sees **your eyes open**, that **juice-god still standing**, and he snarls:

> "*No.*"

---

**The Elemental-**

The very instant your eyes open-**twitches.**

Once.

Then **rumbles**.

It *moves.*

**Shoulders rising.**

Eyes glowing.

Hands curling into fists.

---

The nap is over.

---

**OOC:**

- Your consciousness has **fully returned**-your connection to the Kiwi Elemental restored.
- Crocodile's attack is **moments** from launching.
- Tashigi and Vivi are overwhelmed-**relief, anger, disbelief, joy** in equal measure.

Would you like to:

1. {Command the Elemental to intercept the sand spear.}
2. {Unleash the Elemental's full remaining energy. All in.}
3. {Combine a last fruit technique from yourself to power it. Dual strike.}

>> USER: Option 1 - Have the elemental crash tackle the spear, turn it into muddy, useless mush.

Also my back falls limps as Tashigi briefly lets me go, and I conveniently fall back into... Pillows.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Divine Divebomb]**  
**Scene: "No Sand Shall Pass"**  
**Tone: Triumphant | Mood: Heroic and... Extremely Awkward**

---

The moment the sand spear finishes its arc-gleaming, swirling, massive-

**your eyes snap wide.**

You raise a single, trembling arm-

> "*Intercept it-NOW!!*"

---

And the **Kiwi Elemental responds.**

Not with delay.

Not with hesitation.

With **explosive momentum**.

---

It launches **upward** like a cannonball of citrus vengeance, arms outstretched like a linebacker made of juice and willpower.

It doesn't try to dodge. Doesn't swing wide.

It **tackles** the spear.

**Head-on.**

---

> *SHHHHHHHHRRKRKRRSHHHH-!!*

Sand meets juice.

Dry meets wet.

And the result?

**Mud.**

Sopping, steaming **mud**, splashes down over the plaza in sloppy, defeated globs. The once-lethal projectile is **instantly neutralized**, turned into chunky, embarrassing failure.

---

**Crocodile recoils.**  
His arm jerks back.  
His mouth curls-not in rage.

In **pure disbelief.**

> "What...? *WHAT?*"

---

The Elemental crashes to earth in a dramatic, three-point landing, steam rising from its soaked form.

It growls once.

Raises both arms.

And **flexes.**

---

**Back below...**

> *FLOP.*

Tashigi, finally relaxing her death grip on you, releases you-

And your body **falls backwards** like a lazy noodle.

Your head **once again lands directly in Vivi's lap.**

---

> "Mmm. Deluxe..."

---

**Vivi makes a noise between a gasp and a yelp.**

> "*Wh-again?!*"

---

**Tashigi's mouth falls open.**

> "You've *got* to be kidding me."

---

**Luffy's jaw drops.**

He points.

> "He really *doesn't stop* touching her lap, huh?"

---

**Sanji turns purple.**

**Zoro wheezes.**

---

But then...

The skies clear slightly.

The spear is gone.

The **Elemental stands victorious**.

Crocodile is **staggered**, caught off-guard for the first time.

---

**OOC:**
- Crocodile's attack has been **neutralized.**
- Your Elemental remains active-sluggish but powerful.
- You've officially reclaimed the **Throne of Napdom.**
- Vivi is now questioning everything about life.

Would you like to:

1. {Issue another command-go on the offensive.}
2. {Say something very stupid to Vivi or Tashigi.}
3. {Rest. Briefly. Before the final phase.}

>> USER: Option 2 - I... For the record, whatever I said or did while I was knocked out was not my fault.

My head sinks deeper

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - Pillowgate 2: Electric Boogaloo]**  
**Scene: "The Defense Rests, In Her Lap"**  
**Tone: Hysterical | Mood: Delirious Denial Under Fire**

---

You sigh-deeply, longingly-as your head **sinks once again into what has become the most cursed throne in Alabasta.**  
The **plush lap** of a diplomatic heir.  
Silky. Warm. Slightly judgmental.

---

With eyes barely half-lidded and expression pained only by residual mortal wounds, you murmur:

> "I... for the record..."

> "Whatever I said. Or did. While I was knocked out..."

A beat.

> "...was not my fault."

You squirm an inch deeper into the lap like it's a fruit-shaped mattress and you're checking for firmness ratings.

---

**Vivi** makes a **tiny noise** of sheer flustered indignation. Her face ignites, so red it's like she's secretly a Logia of embarrassment.

> "Y-you-*why are you always landing here?!*"

She tries to shift you off, but your limbs dangle like overcooked noodles.

> "I can't even tell if this is an accident or a strategy anymore!"

---

**Tashigi** lets out a sound that is part snort, part scream, part deep-seated exasperation.

> "I'm filing a report on this."

> "A *long* report."

> "With attachments."

---

Up on the rooftop-

**Crocodile** is still stunned, his hand shaking slightly from the shock of losing his sand spear to an oversized juice blob.

**Luffy**, fists clenched, **grins wide**.

> "You got backup now, Croco-man!"

> "And he's powered by *nap time!!*"

---

The **Kiwi Elemental** stomps forward, slowly but deliberately.

It glances down at you.

Then back to Crocodile.

It raises both arms.

**Juice begins to swirl.**

---

**OOC:**
- You've stabilized.
- The battle momentum has shifted.
- The Elemental is re-energizing.
- Crocodile is rattled.
- You... remain deeply embedded in Vivi's personal space.

Would you like to:

1. {Command the Elemental to assist Luffy.}
2. {Say something to Vivi-sweet, dumb, or both.}
3. {Actually try to sit up. You maniac.}

>> USER: Option 1 / 2 / 3 - Have the elemental continue engaging Crocodile.

Attempt to get out of Vivi's lap like a responsible adult, but my muscles aren't working.

I am so, so sorry about this.
