<pre>ide with unfiltered truth.

> "He could kill us in his sleep. He's **Crocodile.** He took out *Smoker.*  
I'm not stupid. I'm not suicidal."

There's no panic in your tone-just brutal, **adult honesty**, the kind that makes you an excellent teacher and a reluctant hero.

Tashigi looks at you-and this time, she doesn't respond with fire or blind courage.

She nods.  
Quietly.

> "I know."

She watches Crocodile below-*calm, poised, entirely in control*. Then she speaks in that low, focused voice of hers-**the voice of someone who's been left in command by default too many times.**

> "If he pulls that lever, we act. We buy seconds. That's all we need.  
Because if anyone's going to turn this around... it's not you. It's not me."

She nods toward the cage.

> "It's *them.* That pirate crew may be the only group in the world reckless enough to survive this."

You frown, confused.

> "But they're kids-"

> "They're **monsters.** Friendly ones, but monsters."  
> "The green-haired one once cut a galleon in half.  
The Straw Hat broke into a Marine fortress because someone insulted his cook."

You blink.

> "...That's insane."

> "Exactly. So we don't fight Crocodile.  
We give *them* the seconds they need... and then we run like hell."

---

She touches her sword's hilt.

> "That's our role.  
*We're the delay.*  
You slow the gears.  
I break the chain.  
We turn seconds... into a jailbreak."

**📝 Emotional and Tactical Update:**

- You've admitted your fear, and it's been met with trust-not dismissal.  
- Tashigi is stepping into command-mode, **shouldering the suicidal pressure** so you don't have to.  
- Your new role is clear: **not to win. Not to fight Crocodile. Just to stall long enough** for the real chaos to wake up.  
- You have options now-but no illusions.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {"Alright. I'm the slowdown. You're the break point. Let's prep." Begin reinforcing tendrils, get ready.}  
2. {"I want to give Vivi a heads-up. If she knows, she might start waking the others up." Tap a juice thread down.}  
3. {Ask what happens if the cage drops anyway. "Do we have a Plan B? Like... juice raft level Plan B?"}  
4. {Start placing juice reservoirs along the ceiling. If you detonate them later, it'll create distractions or hazards.}  
5. {"Alright. When he moves, you scream. I'll make it rain." Finalize your contingency plan together.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: ​Option 4 - I don't know... But I suppose we've made it this far. Pat her shoulder lightly.

OOC: The more alert denizens of the cage may notice green liquid dripping into the room, but don't know the source. Perhaps it's a plumbing leak?

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 4 Selected - "We've made it this far. Might as well rig the ceiling with juice bombs."**  
**Tone: Determined Resignation | Action: Prepping the Field Quietly**  
**🎲 Juice Reservoir Deployment - (Eatone +2 Control, +1 Stealth, +1 Structural Mapping) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎲 Cage Crew Awareness - (Nami +2 Observation, Zoro +1 Suspicion, -1 Distance) = Result: 4 [Good]**  
**✅ Outcome: You rig the chamber with silent, concealed juice bombs across the ceiling beams. The Straw Hats notice... but without context, they're just confused.**

---

You press your palm gently to Tashigi's shoulder-steady, warm, honest.

> "I don't know if this will work.  
But we've made it this far."

She nods once, no words needed.  
The air between you is solid now-**steel, not fluff.**

You raise your off-hand and **extend five small orbs of juice**, sticky and dense, flowing upward to the metal rafters and recessed supports of the ceiling.

They move like **silent ghosts**, crawling above the chamber like they're **sentries of the fruit itself**.

Each orb lodges into an unseen groove or lip above the following:

- One above the **lever control panel**  
- One above the **cage itself**  
- One directly over **Crocodile's "throne" spot**  
- One above the **pulley brake unit**  
- And a fifth-over the **exit corridor door**, just in case things go sideways

> *Five citric bombs.*  
> Primed. Silent. Suspended in tension.

One snap of your fingers later... and they'll **burst** in sticky, vision-blurring, **traction-ruining citrus hell.**

**Below, in the cage...**

Zoro's eyes open-one eye first, then both. He sniffs.  
Looks up.  
Sees a thin green drop-splat-hit the metal grate.

> "...Juice?"

Nami glances upward too, eyes narrowing.

> "Plumbing leak?" she mutters. "In a deathtrap room?"

Chopper lifts his nose and sniffs.  
> "That smells... like fruit?"

Luffy doesn't move.

Vivi's fingers stop tapping.  
Her gaze turns upward-and **lingers** just a moment too long.

She knows something's changed.  
But she doesn't react.  
Just waits. Tense. Poised.

---

**Crocodile says nothing. Still basking in his own silence. Still waiting for fear to ripen.**

---

**📝 Battlefield Update:**

- Five **juice reservoirs deployed** in key spots-triggerable at will  
- Straw Hat crew (Nami, Zoro, Chopper) has **noticed the presence** of green drips, but is unaware of source  
- Vivi suspects *something*, but plays it close  
- You now have **the entire battlefield prepped** for maximum disruption  
- Crocodile remains unaware. He is... too busy savoring control.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Signal Vivi-if she knows, she can wake the others, subtly prep them. Use juice tap to confirm you're here.}  
2. {Prep a trigger phrase with Tashigi-one word, and you both strike. Decide now.}  
3. {Prep your internal countdown. If Crocodile touches the lever, you detonate the ceiling immediately.}  
4. {Create a juice line across the chamber. In case you need to **swing in** hero-style.}  
5. {Wait. You've done enough for now. Let the pieces sit-see what breaks first.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: ​Option 5 - Maybe Crocodile might leave to let them stew in their mortality. Maybe the cage lowers very, very slowly. Who knows, we might not have to go loud at all.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 5 Selected - "Let's just... not die yet."**  
**Tone: Watchful Patience | Action: Strategic Stillness | Hope: Maybe, just maybe, this resolves itself**  
**🎲 Patience Roll - (Eatone +2 Discipline, +1 Cautious Instincts, +1 Every Adult Decision You've Ever Made) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Crocodile's Action - (Crocodile +2 Theatrics, +1 Sadism, -1 Actual Time Pressure) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**✅ Outcome: Crocodile doesn't trigger the trap. Not yet. He *likes* the waiting game. You gain another window. Your decision to wait is-**for now-**the perfect call.**

---

> "Maybe..."

You whisper it more to yourself than to Tashigi.

> "Maybe he'll leave. Let them stew in it a while longer.  
Or maybe the cage lowers... real slow. I mean, he's a theater kid at heart, isn't he?"

She smirks-tense but appreciative of the gallows humor.

You both settle deeper into the shadows above, **letting stillness become strategy**.

---

**Below:**

Crocodile finishes his cigar, flicking the ash near the edge of the drop pit. It disappears into the gator-churned water below with a hiss.

He doesn't move to the lever.  
Instead, he stands, turns slowly, and gazes up at the ceiling-**not at you**, just at the structure.

> "This place is beautiful, isn't it?" he says, unprompted.  
> "So much iron. So much certainty. You drop a thing from high enough, it breaks.  
No questions. No debate. Nature, in its purest form."

He pauses. Then steps toward the exit corridor, lazily brushing the lever with one gloved hand.

> "Let them sit with it. A little longer.  
The mind breaks faster than the body."

He walks.  
**Right past your bomb above the door.**  
You tense.

But... he **doesn't touch the lever**.

He leaves.

The chamber's silent again-save for the **chain creak** and the **slow, soft mechanical hum**.

The cage?  
**Begins to descend.**

> *But painfully, excruciatingly slowly.*
