<pre> - Friendly Toast (Eatone +2 Rapport, +1 Nobility of Gesture, +1 Juice Aura) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Pit Boss's Guard - Lowering (Cautious +1, Loosened by Hospitality -2) = -1 [Terrible]**  
**✅ Outcome: He accepts. Starts talking. Your position is secure-but what you're seeing near the staff corridor is not.**

---

You hold up your crystal glass with just enough flair to look elegant, not pompous. The light catches on the Mizu Gold like **sunlight over a calm sea.**

> "Hey-you're part of this crowd too. What kind of host would I be if I didn't raise a glass with the man keeping this show running?"

The pit boss hesitates-**a heartbeat too long**. You've seen that moment before, in nervous teachers on parent night. That little flicker of *"am I still in control of this situation?"*

Then, his shoulders drop ever so slightly. He chuckles. Takes the offered glass. Clinks it against yours.

> "To Rain Dinners," he says.

> "To Snack Pack," you counter, and the crowd howls with approval.

He sips. You sip. The flavor is exquisite-**stonefruit, dry plum, a breath of cherry blossom**. Expensive, elegant, and old.

> "This stuff was probably brewed when I still had two good knees," the pit boss mutters.

His tone eases. Eyes crinkle with the first *genuine warmth* you've seen. You keep the smile on your face... but your **mind never leaves that corridor**.

---

You glance over, subtle as a dewfall, watching the staff door through reflections in the **casino's polished decor**. And you notice:

- A **different staff member** stands outside the corridor now. Not in uniform. No name tag. Arms crossed. Not moving.
- Every time someone passes too close, he gently herds them away, like a living velvet rope.
- He's not watching the crowd. He's **listening.**

> *Someone's in there, doing something that needs protection.*

**Should you notify security?**

You consider it.

**On one hand:**
- It's suspicious.
- She may be trespassing, smuggling, or worse.
- *You'd be doing the "right" thing.*

**On the other hand:**
- If that woman really is **royalty**, or worse, a **rebel**, security might respond violently.
- She could be here to sabotage Crocodile's operations-or expose them.
- And you're not supposed to know what you know. If you bring attention, *you bring it to yourself too.*

> It's a gamble, alright. But so is everything in this place.

---

The pit boss glances toward the crowd, then back to you.

> "Y'know... you'd do well in management. You've got the... spark."  
> "Ever think of staying in Rainbase longer than a vacation?"

That *wasn't* just a compliment.

That was **a probe**.

**📝 Updates:**

- 🥂 Pit boss trusts you, now sees you as potential "insider" material.
- 🕵️ You've confirmed: someone is guarding that staff corridor. Something important is happening inside.
- ⚖️ You are at a moral crossroad: to report... or to watch.

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Keep playing the part. Laugh off the job offer, ask for a "tour of the VIP suites"-use it to steer closer to the staff corridor.}
2. {Say you need a restroom and "get turned around" toward the staff corridor. Test if the guard reacts.}
3. {Take the pit boss aside, mention the corridor, and say "you thought you saw something." See how he handles the intel.}
4. {Say nothing. Stay and monitor. Watch who enters and exits the corridor next.}
5. {Excuse yourself politely. Head back to your suite, process this over a whiteboard and kiwi juice.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: OOC: Per canon, what is happening to the characters of note in this current scene?

>> ASSISTANT: **OOC Requested: Canon Character Status - "Rainbase: Just Before the Trap"**  
**Scene Context: You're in Rain Dinners Casino, just prior to Crocodile's trap springing on the Straw Hats.**

You're in the thick of one of the most **critical turning points** of the Alabasta arc. Here's where the **main players** are *canonically* at this very moment:

---

### **Straw Hat Pirates**
**Status: Infiltrating Rain Dinners | Minutes from being captured**

- **Luffy**, **Zoro**, **Nami**, **Usopp**, **Vivi**, and **Chopper** have entered Rain Dinners, attempting to locate and confront **Crocodile** directly.
- They are **not yet captured**, but are inside the structure-somewhere beneath the main casino floor.
- Their goal: Stop Operation Utopia by confronting Crocodile, hoping to force a confession or cut off the coup at its head.
- They are **moments away** from falling into the trap-the **Seastone cage beneath the casino**, suspended over a **Banana Gator pit**.
- **Sanji** is not with them. He has remained **outside, unnoticed**, acting as their backup.

---

### **Nefertari Vivi**
**Status: Active | Inside Rain Dinners | Splitting off from group**

- Vivi is traveling with the Straw Hats.
- She is *very likely the woman in blue you just saw.*
- She's likely moving independently from the others at this moment, attempting to locate her father (**King Cobra**) or intercept Baroque Works agents moving toward **Alubarna**.
- Her presence is not publicly known-if she's recognized, it would instantly trigger a political incident.
- She may be carrying **maps, intel, or the Poneglyph location details**, hoping to disrupt Crocodile's timing.

---

### **Crocodile (Mr. 0)**
**Status: At the heart of Rain Dinners | In control | Awaiting confirmation of Straw Hats' capture**

- Currently monitoring events from his **private suite or command chamber** beneath the casino.
- His Seastone trap is ready and soon to be triggered.
- Unaware of **Sanji's** separate position, but fully expecting the Straw Hats to take the bait.
- Not yet moving personally-waiting for the moment to **deliver his monologue and gloat.**

---

### **Miss All Sunday (Nico Robin)**
**Status: Shadowy presence | Possibly moving between locations**

- Likely aware of the Straw Hats' presence.
- Possibly aware of **Vivi** moving through the casino.
- She may or may not be coordinating with Crocodile *at this precise moment*-or *secretly watching from afar.*

---

### **Captain Smoker & Tashigi**
**Status: Undercover | Inside Rain Dinners' lower level monitoring corridors**

- Smoker is using internal monitoring systems (visible to you earlier) to **observe Rain Dinners' operations**.
- He is **intentionally NOT intervening yet**-waiting to catch Crocodile with undeniable evidence of Baroque Works activity.
- Tashigi is likely close by, or recently separated. She may be attempting her own investigation or contacting Marine support.
- Neither are aware of **Sanji** or the full Straw Hat crew's strategy yet.

---

### **Mr. 2 Bon Clay**
**Status: Left the casino earlier | May return soon in disguise**

- His orders involve **tracking and intercepting Vivi** using his **Clone-Clone powers**.
- He may reappear at any moment in a different form.
- It is possible he's already disguised and moving through the building.

---

### **Your Current Position:**
- You are now **socially dominant** on the casino floor-considered a high-rolling guest.
- You are **near the exact corridor** Vivi just entered.
- If you act now, you may **intercept her** before capture or before Crocodile notices she's broken off from the others.
- Alternatively, you can **let events unfold**, playing the long game while the trap closes around them.

Let me know if you'd like a live timeline or how you'd like to diverge from canon (if at all).

>> USER: Option X - Hah! Management? You flatter me, no I'm just a humble schoolteacher. I enjoy inspiring kids you know?

I wave at the hooting crowd.

In a way, these are kids too. I raise my drink and yell out a toast to Snack Pack's glory.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option X Selected - "Just a humble schoolteacher... who's currently the king of the gator pit."**  
**🎭 Tone: Heartfelt, Humble, Heroic | Status: Peak Crowd Control**  
**🎲 Toast Roll - (Eatone +2 Rapport, +2 Earnest Charm, +1 Public Standing) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎯 Outcome: You own</pre>
