Then, slowly, you rise.

The wooden bench creaks softly beneath your absence, and Vivi's head turns lazily to follow your movement.

You pause, eyes on her for just a beat longer.

Then you reach out, casually-  
And rest your hand lightly atop her crown of wind-tousled hair.

She freezes.

---

> "Don't stay up too late, Blue," you murmur, voice warm, teasing.  
> "You're still in your growing years."

> "Unlike me."

---

She doesn't say anything.

But her head doesn't flinch away, either.  
Her hand lifts briefly, touches your wrist in return-  
A silent *thank you*, and a quiet *stay safe* all wrapped into a moment small enough to miss if you weren't looking for it.

You don't make it a big thing. You never do.

You just turn with a slight wave, and walk off into the palace corridors.

---

The marble floor cools beneath your boots as you move.  
Your room greets you with flickering candlelight, the scent of fresh linen, and the faint hiss of **steaming bathwater** waiting.

Your coat hits the hook.  
The bag of bounty paperwork hits the desk with a damp thump.  
And you?

You slide into the water like a man claiming his **hard-earned reward**.

---

**OOC:**
You've concluded your second day in post-war Alubarna.

**The city is healing.  
You are healing.  
And whether you know it or not...  
They've started to depend on you.**

---

**Rest Well, Sensei.  
You've got a duel at dawn.**

Would you like to:

1. {Sleep immediately. Wake at dawn for the spar with Tashigi.}  
2. {Take 30 minutes to experiment with your Kiwi Alarm elemental before sleep.}

>> USER: Option 2 - place a mini kiwi elemental in the drained bathtub, letting any dripping go down the drain. Try to maintain it as I hop into bed, and slowly fall to sleep.

OOC: Extremely low odds of success

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Guest Quarters, Near Midnight]**  
**Scene: "The Watcher in the Water"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Quiet | Mood: Hopeful, Experimental, Uncertain**

---

The bath's warmth still clings to your skin, a comfort slowly giving way to exhaustion. Steam trails off the marble walls like the last sighs of the day. Your arms ache in that pleasant, lived-in way-equal parts battle fatigue and recovery. Tomorrow, you spar.

Tonight?

You try something new.

---

You pad barefoot across the tiled floor, and kneel by the **now-drained bathtub**.  
A few **trickles of kiwi juice** still cling to the porcelain from earlier, glinting softly in the candlelight. You touch your palm to the edge, pulse your focus through your fingertips.

**Slow. Gentle. Not an attack. Not a wave.**

Just... a whisper.

A request.

---

> *"Be my eyes while I sleep."*

---

The juice ripples.  
Quivers.  
Something forms-slowly.  
**A bud. A nub. A tiny shimmer of semi-cohesive form.**

The size of a coconut.

Its body is more **plop** than **soldier**, and you *immediately* know this is nowhere close to Kiwi-Kop. It lacks arms. Legs. Any real shape. It jiggles in place like flan left too long on a warm counter.

But still-  
It wobbles toward the drain, sits directly on top of it, and **doesn't leak.**

You blink.

> *It's plugging the noise.*

Then-

**"Bloop."**

A soft chirp.  
Barely audible.  
A little hopeful.

---

You stare.

It wobbles.

You nod, slow.

> "...Good enough for a first try."

---

You leave the bathroom door cracked open, flick off the lanterns, and crawl under the covers.

Your body sinks deep. Your eyelids hang heavy.  
Your senses flicker like the last glow of coals under a kettle.

---

And behind it all...

**A tiny bloop.  
Then silence.**

**OOC: Experiment Log - Night One: Subconscious Kiwi Alarm Prototype**  
> **Status:** *Stable. Unintelligent. But real.*  
> **Drain:** Minimal. Estimated functional time: 90 minutes  
> **Behavior:** Passive. Emits light. No current motion logic.  
> **Next steps:** Develop sensory trigger. Possibly link to user heartbeat or sleep rhythms.

---

And you?

You sleep.

**End of Day 2**  
**Next: Day 3 - Dawn Sparring with Tashigi**

**Would you like to:**

1. {Begin with the sparring match next scene.}  
2. {Wake up earlier-have breakfast or check for an update from Vivi or the Marines first?}

>> USER: Option 2 - Observe the dried patch of juice in the tub. Well, as expected, it didn't last the night.

OOC - On a scale of -100 (pure hatred) to 100 (pure love), describe my character's current relationship levels with relevant characters. -75 would be extreme dislike, 75 would be devoted friend.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Guest Room, Morning of Day 3]**  
**Scene: "Post-Dreams and Pre-Duels"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Lightly Reflective | Mood: Emerging Calm, A Dash of Scientific Disappointment**

---

The sun pierces through the palace curtains like a polite but insistent school bell.

You groan, roll over, and blink blearily into the glow of morning.

Your joints ache. Your mouth is dry. Your dreams were weird. Something about Snack Pack leading a parade.

And the **first thing you do**-because of course you do-is shuffle across the floor, tug open the bathroom door, and peer into the **tub**.

---

There's no golem. No bloop.

Just a faint **stain of dried juice**, clinging to the porcelain like a failed science project and the ghost of a good idea.

You sigh.

> "Well. That tracks."

You flick the light switch.

> *Flick.* *Flick.*

No movement. No chirp.  
The thing is deader than Crocodile's ego post-defeat.

---

Still.

That was a start.

---

You towel your face, splash on water, and reach for your coat.

There's a duel waiting.  
And breakfast.  
Possibly in that order.

**Relationship Levels (Current Arc Status):**

**Vivi Nefertari** - *Score: 78*  
> She sees you as a protector, a peer, and someone who never demanded the spotlight. Your words and actions remind her of the best parts of her kingdom's ideals. There's warmth in her glances now, comfort in your presence. She may not know what you are to her yet-but she trusts you deeply.

**Tashigi** - *Score: 70*  
> Mutual respect forged through battle and quiet kebab-sharing. She sees you as an ally, an anchor, and-though she'd never admit it-a growing source of calm in her whirlwind life. She's starting to view your presence as... dependable. And maybe more.

**Smoker** - *Score: 45*  
> Professionally skeptical. Personally impressed. He doesn't fully understand you, but he recognizes genuine effort and a willingness to *not be useless*. He'd trust you to guard his flank in a fight... though maybe not to fill out a field report without adding drawings.

**Straw Hat Crew:**
- **Luffy** - *Score: 50*  
  Thinks you're funny, juicy, and fun. Doesn't know if you're a hero or a weird fruit-dad. Trusts you anyway.
- **Zoro** - *Score: 25*  
  Barely acknowledges you unless you're holding a weapon. Hasn't decided if you're worth remembering.
- **Nami** - *Score: 40*  
  Grateful you didn't turn them in. Especially grateful you didn't try to collect their bounties. Has a running tally of how many times you've played "hero" without charging anyone.
- **Usopp / Chopper / Sanji** - *Score: 60 (Group Avg.)*  
  They think you're either cool or hilarious. Sanji isn't quite sure what to make of your proximity to Vivi.
- **Robin** - *Unknown*  
  Her status as Miss All Sunday remains a thread dangling in the wind.

**King Cobra** - *Score: 55*  
> Finds you honorable, if extremely bizarre. Deeply respects your promise to "Blue." Still unsure if the *baton thwack* was bravery, foolishness, or both.

**Rain Dinners Hotel Management** - *Score: -87*  
> You will **not</pre>
