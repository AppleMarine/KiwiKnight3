<pre>next move **count.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Head for the docks. Wait. Intercept the crew as they emerge.}  
2. {Find high ground near the northwest gate. Be their overwatch.}  
3. {Ask a vendor casually if they've seen a bunch of damp weirdos with swords and antlers.}  
4. {Prep a juice trap in the alley near the gate. If agents pursue, they'll eat pulp.}  
5. {Try to find a public Den Den Mushi booth. Time to **warn the Marines** about Crocodile.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 5 - I'm probably 5 minutes away from getting assassinated. Might as well get help on the horn.

OOC: Crocodile may have activated a lockdown across the city and cut outside comms

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 5 Selected - "I'm Probably on a Kill List-Might as Well Dial the Navy."**  
**Tone: Deadpan Urgency | Action: Try to Warn the Marines Before the Lines Go Dark**  
**🎲 Den Den Mushi Access Roll - (Eatone +2 City Awareness, +1 Luck, -2 Emergency Lockdown Protocols) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**🎲 Crocodile's Lockdown Interference - (+2 Control of Rainbase Infrastructure, -1 Short Notice, -1 System Lag) = Result: 4 [Good]**  
**❌ Outcome: You find a Den Den Mushi booth. You even dial. But just as it begins to connect... the line **goes dead.** Crocodile's grip is already closing.

---

> "If I'm going to get murdered in five minutes,  
I might as well leave a message for whoever finds the body."

You jog across the plaza, eyes scanning, citrus scent still trailing behind you like a sad, juicy cloud.

Then-there.

> **A public Den Den Mushi booth.**  
Dusty. Sun-faded. But open.

You hustle inside, slap a few coins into the port, and twist the dial like you're playing **cursed roulette**. The snail sluggishly lifts its eyes, bleary from disuse.

> "Come on, come on..."

You dial your **home-island Marine office**-the junior officer you've had drinks with, the one who owes you for helping his idiot brother pass his math final.

The snail **blinks**.  
The receiver **crackles**.

> *Ch-kkkk-Connecting-Khhh-Rainbase Central Outbound-please hold-*

And then-

> *click*  
> *BZZZZZZZZZZT*

Dead line.  
The snail **shudders**, shrinks into its shell, and **shuts down.**

A little red tag flaps down in front of your face:

> **"EMERGENCY LOCKDOWN - ALL OUTBOUND LINES JAMMED PER CITY COMMAND"**

You stare.  
One eye twitches.

> "Yup. There it is."

---

**OOC Update:**  
Crocodile has activated **Rainbase-wide lockdown protocols**-all **external communications are now jammed**.  
The city is becoming a **closed box**, designed to crush and bury the threat inside.

**You, unfortunately, are the threat.**

---

**📝 Status Update:**

- Den Den Mushi line: **cut. Locked down. No external contact.**  
- City: Entering full lockdown. You've got **minutes** before streets start sealing, patrols tighten, and escape routes vanish.  
- The Straw Hats and Tashigi: Still en route to the **northwest gate and docks**  
- You: **Alone, outside Rain Dinners.** Free. But for how long?

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Sprint for the docks. Find them, warn them-now. This is your last open corridor.}  
2. {Look for a quiet spot to hide and recover. You may need to outlast the lockdown.}  
3. {Find a local and bluff a Marine ID. Maybe *someone* can get you to a secure line.}  
4. {Search for a boat. If the worst happens, you need a personal exfil plan.}  
5. {Use the juice. Mark the roads behind you with fresh trails-if the Straw Hats see it, they'll know where you went.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Northwest? Which way is Northwest?

Option 1 - But head in a random direction that may or may not be Northwest. I have a 1/8 chance!

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected - "Which Way is Northwest? Let's Just Guess and Run Like Hell."**  
**Tone: Heroic Panic with a Dash of Cardinal Confusion**  
**🎲 Directional Guess Roll - (Eatone +0 Intuition, -1 Exhaustion, +1 Casino Architecture Familiarity) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**🎲 Actual Direction - (Randomization Table Rolled) = *Southwest* (Close... ish)**  
**✅ Outcome: You *do not* run northwest... but you're not entirely off course either. You're now barreling along the **western perimeter**, a hair south of the intended rendezvous point. You're close. You're *juicily close.***

---

> "Northwest... northwest... where the hell is *northwest?!*"

You spin in a circle like a citrus-powered compass needle with low battery.  
The sun's in the sky-but high enough that your usual "shadow trick" is basically useless.

> "Okay. I'll just... go **that** way."

You point dramatically toward an alley between two restaurants-smelling vaguely of fried fish and questionable shellfish.

Then you **run.**

---

The alley bends west, then slopes down toward the sea.  
Palm fronds whip past your face.  
A startled old woman yells at you in a dialect you don't recognize.  
You nearly bowl over a cart of plastic-wrapped grilled squid.

But then-

> You spot a **dock.**

And more importantly?

> You see **people.**

Not your people. Not yet.  
But **sailors. Vendors.** Market dwellers scattering.  
They've heard something's wrong.  
They're **nervous**.

You're just **a few streets off target.**

---

**Somewhere ahead, the Straw Hats and Tashigi are pushing toward the *real* docks.**  
And you're **close enough to smell victory.**

...and also leftover kebab oil.

---

**📝 Tactical Status:**

- You are *southwest* of the intended escape point.  
- You can **reach the rendezvous** with one more well-timed dash or **a smart navigation check.**  
- No enemies in sight. But **lockdown patrols could appear at any moment.**  
- You're running out of time-and out of **safe mistakes**.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Climb up a vendor stall and look for the Straw Hats from high ground.}  
2. {Ask a local which way the main shipping dock is-fast.}  
3. {Keep running west. One more street and you might see them.}  
4. {Use a burst of juice to skate forward, sliding between crowds at speed.}  
5. {Shout: "Oi! Weird crew! Blue hair! Talking reindeer! Anyone seen ‘em?!" Hope echoes are kind.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 2 - Yo! I'm about to miss my boat! I flash a few beris. Anyone camel taxis able to get me to the main docks? Pretend to be a wealthy tourist

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 2 Selected - "Yo! I'm About to Miss My Boat! Camel Taxi-Stat!"**  
**Tone: Haggard But High-Rolling Tourist | Action: Beri-Flashing Camel Extraction**  
**🎲 Bluff & Bribe Roll - (Eatone +2 Fake Wealth, +1 Urgency, +1 Citrus Camouflage) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎲 Local Response - (+2 Camel Driver Hustle, +1 Fear of Rainbase Lockdown) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**✅ Outcome: You flash the cash, and three camel drivers appear like magic. You're hoisted up and galloping toward the main docks in seconds-*just in time* to intercept the crew.**

---

You jog up to the nearest knot of vendors, trying to ignore the ache in your calves and the drying streaks of kiwi juice on your jacket.

> "Yo! I'm about to miss my boat-hey, hey! Camel taxi, main docks? I'll pay double! Triple if we make it before the sandstorm lockdown!"

You **flash a handful of Beri** like a desperate big spender on vacation.

For a second, the crowd just blinks.  
Then-a **young camel driver** with a scar over one brow and a salesman's grin pushes forward, hand raised.

> "Triple? Sir, for triple we'll get you there before your juice dries! Come, come-Prime Camel Express!"

Another two drivers jump in, trying to outbid him. You hop onto the nearest camel's saddle-ignoring the citrus you leave behind.

> "Main docks! NOW!"

The driver **whistles sharply** and the camel *lurches* forward, sprinting down the sunbaked road, weaving past startled vendors and scattering children.

**Street by street, you close the gap.**

The air thickens with **tension** and the taste of imminent lockdown.  
Patrols are moving, but your camel slides past them with an ease bought by *coin and chao</pre>
