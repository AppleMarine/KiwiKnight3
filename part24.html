<pre>e flawlessly. Undetected. One step closer to the heart of Crocodile's trap.**

---

You make a sharp series of **tactical hand signals**, pointing first to the **left camera**, then to the **right**, followed by a flat-palm circular motion:  
**"Rotating, four-second blind spot."**  
Then two fingers to your eyes, then down the unmarked hallway:  
**"Eyes forward. Target this way."**

Tashigi nods once, blade low, body coiled like a spring.  
No words.  
Just a slight flex of her shoulder and a silent **"ready."**

---

> **You move.**

As soon as the camera eyes shift away, you slip past the intersection-fluid and silent, your shoes barely making a sound. Tashigi mirrors you flawlessly, following your exact line of motion with ghostlike precision.

**No alerts.  
No alarm snails.  
No yelling from Baroque goons.**

Only the soft, echoing sound of **dripping chains** as you approach the end of the corridor.

---

**You come to a halt at a grated walkway**, where a **large drop** opens below you-maybe 15 meters down.

Peering carefully over the edge, you see:

- A **massive stone chamber**, artificially excavated and reinforced with iron.  
- In the center, suspended by **titanium-alloy cables**, hangs a **huge cage** made of **Sea-Prism Stone bars**.  
- Inside: five people.  
  - A **boy in a straw hat**, slumped but breathing.  
  - A green-haired man.  
  - A small reindeer in a hat.  
  - A blonde girl in business attire.  
  - And-**Vivi. Blue hair. Very much real.**

Below the cage: **murky water**, churning faintly.

You see **Banana Gators** circling below. At least three. Maybe more.

> *And there's no one else visible. No guards. No Crocodile. No Robin.*

Tashigi leans next to you and whispers:

> "That's the Seastone cage. They're inside."  
> "If it drops... that's it."

You still don't know what Seastone really means, but **your instincts are firing like a fire alarm in the chemistry lab.**

---

**📝 Situation Update:**

- You've reached the edge of Crocodile's trap chamber.  
- You have **visual** on Vivi and the Straw Hats-**alive**, but confined.  
- **No enemies in sight... yet.**  
- The cage is suspended above Banana Gators. One mistake, and it's over.  
- You are in stealth. No one knows you're here.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Whisper to Tashigi: "What's Seastone? Can we break that cage?" Learn first, act second.}  
2. {Start forming juice tendrils down the wall-create a silent descent path. Maybe you can reach them.}  
3. {Wait. Observe. Crocodile could be coming soon. Let him monologue and give you intel.}  
4. {Send a juice signal to the cage. Just a splash. Alert Vivi someone's coming-but subtly.}  
5. {Pull back. You've got their position. Time to find a way to disable the trap from afar.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 3 - I turn to Tashigi and whisper - what... What the hell is going on? Who's blue over there? Who's the kids? Why are they kids? Is there a kid diddler around here? Where's smoker?

I babble, a stream of consciousness as the scene overwhelms me in confusion.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 3 Selected - "...What the hell is going on?"**  
**Tone: Overwhelmed Civilian With Front-Row Seats to the Boss Fight**  
**🎲 Mental Overload Roll - (Eatone +2 Confusion, +1 Emotional Honesty, -1 Gator-Induced Adrenal Fatigue) = Result: 2 [Fair]**  
**🎲 Tashigi's Response - (+2 Mission Focus, +1 Soft Spot for Chaos Under Pressure) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**✅ Outcome: You babble. Tashigi keeps you anchored. And finally gives you the full download, no filters.**

---

Your eyes lock on the surreal nightmare below.  
A spinning soup of facts, faces, and **Banana Gator teeth** start to fold in on themselves in your brain.

You lean close to Tashigi, **still whispering**, but with the breathless desperation of a man trying to keep his last few **functional brain cells** from leaping off the balcony.

> "What... what the hell is going on? Who's blue over there? That *has* to be the girl I saw.  
And who the hell are those kids? *Why are they kids?!*  
Is there a **kid diddler** in this situation? Because that's **my jurisdiction.** I swear if this whole coup has a predator angle-"

Your voice goes up a little. You catch yourself.  
The juice orb in your hand shudders with the tension.

> "And where is your *captain*? Isn't he supposed to be in here punching the Warlord in the throat?!"

Tashigi stares at you.

Then places a single hand gently on your shoulder.

> "Eatone."

> "Yeah?"

> "Breathe."

You do.  
Barely.

Then she begins, voice just above a whisper-but *perfectly controlled*.

---

> "The girl in blue is **Princess Vivi Nefertari**. Of Alabasta.  
She infiltrated Baroque Works months ago to learn who was behind the rebellion tearing her kingdom apart."

> "That sounds... like an insane extracurricular."

> "The ones in the cage? Those are the **Straw Hat Pirates.**"

You blink.

> "They're pirates?"

> "Yes. But not the bad kind."

She sighs.

> "The one with the straw hat is **Monkey D. Luffy.** The World Government has no idea what to do with him.  
He's the kind of person who punches a Celestial Dragon *and then makes friends with the guy he just punched.*"

> "That's not a real sentence."

> "They followed Vivi here. They're trying to help her stop the coup."

She lowers her voice even further.

> "And if they're in the cage-**so is Smoker.** He was tailing them.  
Crocodile must've caught them all at once. He was waiting for them."

You glance down again.

The girl in the suit (Nami) is pacing.  
The swordsman (Zoro) looks pissed.  
The kid in the hat is slumped... but not unconscious.

And Vivi... Vivi is gripping the bars like a woman praying the bars are fake.

---

**📝 You now know:**

- The Straw Hats are not random kids. They are **infamous pirates**, but known to oppose evil.
- Princess Vivi is **actively trying to stop the civil war.**
- Smoker is likely in the cage, out of view.
- This is **Crocodile's big move**-you are here *just* before the moment where canon breaks wide open.

Tashigi glances at you.

> "Still with me?"

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {"...Alright. Let's get them out." Begin forming a plan to reach the cage or stop the trap.}
2. {Stay quiet. Watch. Crocodile might appear at any second-this could be *the moment*.}
3. {Use juice to signal Vivi. Let her know someone *good* is nearby.}
4. {Whisper: "Okay. So what's *your* plan?" Let Tashigi lead this phase.}
5. {"So hypothetically, what would *not* set off an alarm?" Try to access the trap controls.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 2 - If smoker's down there somewhere, whoever caught smoker could be down there too. Let's not be too reckless here.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 2 Selected - "If Smoker's in the cage... whoever caged him is still nearby."**  
**Tone: Rational Caution | Status: Recon-Over-Rescue Instinct**  
**🎲 Tactical Insight Roll - (Eatone +2 Danger Awareness, +1 Respect for Chain of Command) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Tashigi's Reaction - (+2 Professional Alignment, +1 Shared Worry, -1 Urge to Act Fast) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**✅ Outcome: You hold position. Tashigi agrees. You're now both in full recon mode, awaiting the arrival of the true threat.**

---

You stare down at the cage suspended in that cavernous room like a **hook baited with people**-and your gut coils into a dense little fist of alarm.

> "If Smoker's down there somewhere..."  
> "Then *whoever* was strong enough to take him out is still nearby."

You don't raise your voice. You don't flinch.  
But your hand tightens ever so slightly on your baton.

> "Let's not be reckless. Not yet."

Tashigi narrows her eyes, lips tightening in grim approval. She nods.

> "Agreed. We can't win a fight we don't understand."

She crouches lower, motioning you back just slightly from the ledge. Together, you settle into the **railing's shadow**, backs to the wall, **eyes on the drop**.

Your juice orb pulses quietly in your p</pre>
