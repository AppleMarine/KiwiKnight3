<pre> without waking you, **dabs a bit of dried juice from your cheek.**

---

In the stillness, **Vivi arrives not long after**, dressed in a pale robe, hair down over her shoulders. She pauses when she sees Tashigi already seated.

There's a flicker of **mutual embarrassment**, and then-understanding.

No words.

She walks over and takes the other chair.

---

For a while, neither of them speak.

They simply sit-one princess, one soldier-listening to the quiet, feeling the **absence of bombs, blades, and barking orders.**

Feeling the **presence** of someone who should've died, and didn't.

---

After a long moment, Tashigi speaks, her voice soft:

> "He said I wasn't allowed to die. That he'd save me, every time."

Vivi looks at you, then at Tashigi.

> "And yet he keeps almost dying *himself.*"

> "Selfish idiot."

> "Big-hearted idiot."

> "...Yeah."

---

They fall silent again.

The night deepens.

Your breathing never falters.

---

Eventually, **Tashigi's head leans sideways**, resting lightly against the bed frame.

**Vivi leans forward**, folding her arms beside your pillow, forehead resting atop them, close enough to feel your warmth.

---

And so the cocooned man sleeps...

Surrounded by the two lives he saved.

And guarded, in silence, by those who now silently vow to protect *him.*

---

**OOC: Scene End.**  
Would you like to begin the next day with morning recovery-or a soft wake-up with visitors still nearby?

>> USER: Option 1 - dream of warmth. Also wake up feeling unusual sources of nearby warmth.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Royal Palace - Infirmary, Dawnlight Filtering In]**  
**Scene: "Shared Heat"**  
**POV: You (Dreamer, Slowly Waking)**  
**Tone: Gentle | Mood: Vulnerable, Soft, Faintly Embarrassing**

---

You drift, somewhere between sleep and sensation.

**No fire. No pain. No explosions.**

Just... **warmth.**

A soft cocoon of it, not just from the bandages, but *around* you. A memory of comfort-like an old classroom blanket, or a late afternoon sunbeam catching you asleep on a teacher's lounge chair. There's citrus in it, yes, but it's mellow now. Reassuring. Homey.

And other things:

**The weight of silk. The faint scent of perfume. Leather, metal polish, and wildflowers.**

And then-movement.

Something shifts beside your pillow.

Another presence shifts near your arm.

**Both warm. Both real.**

---

Your eyelids peel open slowly, blinking against the morning haze. The light isn't blinding-it's **soft**, filtered through gauze curtains fluttering gently in the dawn breeze.

You don't remember falling asleep this peacefully.

And yet... you haven't woken alone.

---

To your immediate left, resting with uncharacteristic vulnerability, **Tashigi's head lies slumped near your shoulder**, tucked just against the crook of your arm. One of her hands is gently curled against her jacket, her **glasses slightly askew**, hair uncharacteristically down and **resting against your bicep.**

To your right, curled halfway on the bed, her arms folded gently atop the edge of the mattress, **Vivi breathes slowly**, her cheek pressed against her forearm, hair like a curtain across her eyes. She murmurs something unintelligible in her sleep-a twitch of a smile crossing her face.

---

You freeze.

The heat from both sides is unmistakable.  
So is the way they're **unconsciously leaning in**-seeking warmth. Or something more.

And you... are **the warmth.**

---

> "...Okay," you whisper hoarsely to no one.  
> "Definitely not dead. This is way too cozy for hell."

Your ribs groan a little when you shift.

Neither of them stirs.

---

For one perfect moment, you're **held in place not by wounds-but by affection**.

And despite the aching, the scars, the months of blood and sweat and citrus...

**You don't move.**

You just lie there.

And let yourself be cared for.

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Stay still and quietly enjoy it. Let them wake naturally.}  
2. {Try to slowly, delicately sit up... and likely disturb both.}  
3. {Say something. A joke. A whisper. Something to mark this moment.}</pre>
