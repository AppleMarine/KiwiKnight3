> "Only when it's not cleaning up my own damn powers."

---

She smirks.

> "Should've filed a formal request to your own department of fruit misuse."

---

You both share a tired laugh.

No pressure.

No need to say much more.

Just two people, late at night, fixing what they can.

---

After a while, as the mops begin slowing and the last few puddles are more memory than mess, **Tashigi leans back against a sun-warmed pillar**, arms crossed, her mop tucked beside her.

> "So..."

> "You're really staying?"

She doesn't say it with surprise.

Just quiet confirmation.

---

You nod.

> "Looks that way."

---

She watches you a moment longer.

Then, voice low:

> "Good."

A beat.

> "You belong here more than you think."

---

There's a silence again-softer this time.

Like the city's holding its breath.

You both stand in the open, no war left, no mission pending.

Just... the weight of things unsaid.

---

She pushes off the column.

Brushes some hair behind her ear.

Then, casual-*too* casual:

> "So... breakfast tomorrow?"

---

You blink.

> "I mean, I'm already freeloading off royal meals, so-"

She gives you a look.

> "*With me*, pineapple."

---

A beat.

Then a chuckle.

> "Sure."

---

She grabs her mop.

Turns.

Doesn't say goodnight.

Just:

> "Don't oversleep. I'll find you."

And then she's gone.

---

You're alone again.

Sort of.

The stones are clean now.

The bucket's empty.

And you can still feel the faint **smell of citrus** in the air-

But now it smells like **home.**

---

**OOC:**
Let me know when you're ready to continue to...

1. {Your new life in Alabasta.}  
2. {A full epilogue.}  
3. {A late-night walk through the now-quiet capital... where someone else may find you.}

>> USER: Option 3 - Look for a post office that's still open. I've ought to send a resignation later to my school. It's the responsible thing to do. I wander out of the palace and into the capital proper, observing the city, still rebuilding from war.

**POV: You**

---

The bucket's been rinsed and set aside.

The mop leans against the courtyard wall like a well-used weapon, steam still faintly curling from the sun-stained handle.

And you?

You've slung your jacket back on.

Bandages still tucked beneath your shirt.

Feet still sore.

Eyes heavy.

But the weight on your chest?

**A little lighter.**

---

You wander out of the palace gates-no guards stop you. They recognize you now. You're not a tourist anymore.

You're **Eatone Cheng**.

The schoolteacher who faced a Warlord with a collapsible baton, a mouth full of sarcasm, and a juice-based battle cry.

---

**The capital glows faintly under oil lanterns** strung between cracked walls and scaffolded rooftops. Some shops are open, offering bread and tea and stubborn normalcy. Some are closed, wood boards freshly painted, windows taped with faded signs saying *We'll return soon.*

Children dart between alleys, laughing like they haven't yet understood what the war cost.

A group of older teens-maybe future soldiers, maybe future rebels-nods to you in recognition as you pass.

Not because of fame.

But because **they remember** what you did.

---

You stop outside a **tiny post office**, its roof scorched, but its hanging sign proudly intact.

Inside, an old woman waves from behind a repaired desk, sorting letters with hands that move like they've been doing it since before the Grand Line had a name.

---

You borrow a seat. A quill. A little ink.

She slides you a stack of paper, then winks.

> "First page is free, hero."

You don't argue.

You just begin.

---

**Dear Principal Korra,**

You pause.

Let the ink dry a moment.

Then keep going.

---

> I'm writing to inform you that I won't be returning to the school after summer break ends.

> I apologize for the lack of earlier notice. I was delayed by...

> ...several incidents involving international terrorism, royal insurgencies, a Warlord of the Sea, and one very, very large fruit elemental.

---

You glance out the window.

Watch as a child clumsily wipes paint onto a wall mural-of Vivi, of Cobra, and of *someone vaguely pineapple-shaped.*

---

> I know I was only part-time.

> But I hope I made a difference, even for one of them.

---

You stop again.

The page is only half full.

But somehow, it feels finished.

You sign it with a tired flourish.

**Eatone Cheng**  
**Educator, Civilian... Alabastan Resident**

---

You seal the letter.

The old woman accepts it wordlessly and offers you a cup of something warm.

---

As you sip on the palace steps hours later, looking out at a city rebuilding, you don't feel regret.

Not yet.

Not ever.

Just... *real.*

---

**You didn't die a hero.**

But you *lived like one.*

---

**OOC:**
Let me know when you're ready for your **first day as an official resident of Alabasta**, or if you'd prefer to skip ahead to a possible **epilogue years down the road**. Either way...

**You're home now.**

>> USER: Wander around the evening city, assisting with rebuilding here and there.

Huh. Why did Tashigi word getting breakfast like that? And also, why does everyone keep calling me pineapple?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - A City Putting Itself Back Together]**  
**Scene: "Pineapple in the Dust"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Gentle | Mood: Reflective, Curious, Softly Humorous**

---

You stroll through the streets of Alubarna, hands in your pockets, steps slow-not from pain (though that's still there), but from **intent**.

The city's still humming with energy-*not chaos*, not anymore, but the stubborn, relentless movement of a place trying to *heal.*

---

You pass a scaffolding where **a wiry old man is attempting to hold three planks at once** while yelling at someone half his size.

You catch the topmost before it topples, slide it into place, and offer the younger one a grin before giving a few calm instructions-**"Nail at an angle, there. Trust me."**

You walk on before they can thank you too much.

---

Near a plaza, you help **replant a half-uprooted flowerbed** beside a merchant stall.  
Children squabble over who gets the corner plot.  
You settle it with a teacher's raised eyebrow and a three-part rock-paper-scissors tournament.

---

You're *doing nothing grand.*

But every corner you pass?

**Stays a little better than before.**

---

And somewhere, as your hands brush grit off your jacket, a strange thought drifts in-gentle, harmless at first, but sticky:

> *Why did Tashigi say it like that?*

---

The breakfast thing.

The way she phrased it.

Like it wasn't just a **meal.**

Like she'd already **bookmarked** that time. That space. With you in it.

---

You squint toward the horizon, scratching your cheek.

> "...It's just breakfast."

A pause.

> "Right?"

---

You shake your head.

And then it hits again.

Right after a kid runs by yelling:

> "WATCH OUT, IT'S THE PINEAPPLE MAN!"

---

You stop mid-step.

Turn slowly.

> "Okay, no, seriously-*what is that about??*"

---

The kid vanishes, laughing.

You groan into your palm.

> "I don't even look like a pineapple."

You touch your hair self-consciously.

> "...Do I?"

---

From a rooftop, someone yells:

> "IT'S THE KIWI GUARDIAN!"

Another voice shouts:

> "PINEAPPLE KNIGHT!"

A third yells:

> "JUICE-DAD!"

---

You sigh so hard your soul almost escapes.

---

**OOC:**
Would you like the next beat to be:

1. {The morning after - breakfast with Tashigi.}
2. {Someone else corners you that night-maybe Vivi.}
3. {A moment of peace-rooftop stargazing alone, reflecting.}

>> USER: Option 2 - continue wandering the town and lending a hand here and there. Wonder what cost of living is in Alubarna compared to my hometown, and think of redoing my monthly budgeting notes.
