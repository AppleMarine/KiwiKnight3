<pre>till.**

---

**The Banana Gators lurch**-surprised by the sudden lack of progress. One tries to jump, but only hits open air and **splashes down hard**, churning froth and anger below.

One of them **snaps at another**, agitated by the delay.  
You've stalled their feeding frenzy.  
**You've stolen Crocodile's timing.**

---

Tashigi remains perfectly in position-watching the lock like a coiled trap.

Inside the cage, **the Straw Hats all blink.**  
Zoro nods slowly.  
Nami grips the bars and **smiles for the first time since you arrived.**  
Vivi?

She exhales, shoulders lowering slightly, eyes never leaving you.

---

**üìù Tactical Update:**

- **Cage descent: HALTED. Two meters above water. Mechanisms jammed.**  
- **Tashigi in guard position.** She's holding the fail-chain.  
- **Straw Hats: Now *fully aware* you're on their side. Morale: Rising.**  
- **Gators: Confused, disorganized.**  
- **Chamber: Yours. For now.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Speak up. "We're getting you out." Begin unlocking or cutting the cage.}  
2. {Ask Vivi directly: "Are you hurt?" Check the state of the group. Prioritize triage.}  
3. {Have Tashigi assist with the cage while you form juice platforms below-just in case the cage drops.}  
4. {Prep a trap at the hallway Crocodile exited through. You don't trust him to stay gone.}  
5. {Climb onto the cage. Start inspecting the top for locks or vulnerabilities. Engineer this escape.}

üåÄ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: ‚ÄãOption X - remain silent. Motion to Tashigi's sword, then to the bars of the cage, and tilt my head questioningly. Observe the caged reactions.

>> ASSISTANT: **üé≤ Option X Selected - "No Words. Just Steel, Citrus, and a Question."**  
**Tone: Silent Leadership | Action: Tactical Nonverbal Coordination**  
**üé≤ Communication Clarity Roll - (Eatone +2 Nonverbal Expression, +1 Situation Awareness) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**üé≤ Straw Hat Insight - (Nami +2, Zoro +1, Vivi +2, Group Coordination +1) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**‚úÖ Outcome: The message is clear. Tashigi understands. The Straw Hats understand. You're not just random rescue-**you're a plan in motion.**

---

You keep your mouth shut.

> No dramatic rescue speech.  
> No declaration of justice.  
> Just a gesture.

You point to **Tashigi's sword**.

Then to the **bars of the cage**.  
A slight tilt of your head. *"Can it be done?"*

Tashigi's brows furrow for just a beat-but then her eyes widen slightly with realization.

> She nods.  
> Once. Firm. Controlled.

She steps closer to the cage, running two fingers along a bar. Tests it.  
Her blade shifts in her grip.

She mouths, silently:

> **Seastone.**

Then crosses her arms to form an "X"-**can't cut it.**

> *Damn.*

---

But your eyes stay on the cage.

You shift your gaze inside. Watch the crew.

**Vivi's expression shifts first**-from fear to a kind of **purposeful calculation.** She watches you like someone who's suddenly found the thread of a riddle.

She taps the bar softly-twice, pause, twice.

> *"I understand."*

**Nami watches your exchange**, then eyes the winch assembly and chain brake-realization dawning.  
She nods at Vivi.

> "They're planning something."

**Zoro squats, tension coiled.**  
One hand on his bandana.  
Just in case.

**Chopper peeks from behind Luffy.**  
> "I think the pineapple guy's with us!"

Luffy's eyes open slightly.  
He blinks once.  
Smiles.

> "He smells like juice."

---

Tashigi whispers beside you:

> "We can't cut the bars.  
But if we disengage the top link... we might be able to lift the whole thing with your juice. Or tip it."

She watches you.

> "You want to make this cage useless, Cheng... you've got about **thirty seconds** before Crocodile realizes he forgot to monologue about *why he's always one step ahead.*"

---

**üìù Status Recap:**

- **Cage is jammed mid-drop. Seastone bars: uncuttable.**  
- Straw Hats: **Fully aware.** Mentally synced. Ready to move on your lead.  
- Vivi: Actively following your visual cues.  
- Tashigi: Awaiting your next direction.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Climb the cage. Inspect or begin juice-dissolving the top link. Try to open it like a kiwi.}  
2. {Send juice into the link joint, swell it slowly, try to *pop* it from the inside. Quiet force.}  
3. {Tilt the cage-build a juice ramp on one side and tip the cage just enough to unseat it. Risky but dramatic.}  
4. {Look to Nami and Vivi. Motion for them to be ready to move. Juice will do the rest.}  
5. {Hold position. Lay more juice into the pulley above. You *might* be able to reverse the winch.}

üåÄ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: ‚ÄãOption X - start pacing nervously, quietly. Shit, cutting the bars was Plan A. I don't think I'll have time to destroy the mechanisms before Croc notices something off...

I eye the lock. It's not Seastone, but it sure looks hardened. Maybe not cuttable. but maybe, a kiwi key...

>> ASSISTANT: **üé≤ Option X Selected - "Plan A is dead. Long live... the Kiwi Key."**  
**Tone: Rapid-Onset Anxiety Meets MacGyver-Level Improvisation**  
**üé≤ Improvisational Insight Roll - (Eatone +2 Cleverness, +1 Pressure-Stress Thinking, +1 Fruit-Based Improvisation History) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**üé≤ Lock Resistance Check - (Hardened Alloy +2, Not Seastone -1, Age -1) = Result: 0 [Mediocre]**  
**‚úÖ Outcome: The bars can't be cut. The mechanism can't be yanked. But the *lock*? You might be able to **grow your way in.** And it might just work-**if you're precise.**

---

You start pacing.

Quiet. Controlled.

But not calm.

> "Shit..."

You whisper it through your teeth like it might slide into a shadow and never return.

> "Cutting the bars was Plan A.  
Now we're on Plan... kiwi."

Tashigi looks over, alert-but doesn't speak. She can tell you're calculating.

You glance up at the **cage's hanging lock**, the only visible **hinge point** connecting the Seastone cage to the **steel-reinforced support ring**.

> *Not Seastone.*  
> *Not meant to resist power-just weight.*

> *A weakness.*

It's old. Worn.  
Thick, yes-but the **keyhole is exposed**, and the steel around it isn't quite as polished as the rest.

And then your eyes narrow.

You reach into your palm and begin forming something small-something **thinner**, more focused. Not a blast. Not a flood. Something **precise**.

> "...Maybe I can grow a key."

You press your juice into the shape of a **soft vine**, narrowing it to the width of a **lockpick**, then curling it gently, letting it harden into a pliable, fibrous rod.

A **kiwi juice filament**, condensed, acidic enough to eat into cheap metal, and strong enough to **wiggle.**

You guide it with a twitch of your fingers-sliding it toward the lock.

Tashigi leans in slightly.

> "What are you doing?"

> "Making fruit-based locksmithing history."

---

The filament reaches the keyhole. You insert it slowly. No force. No splash.

> *click*  
> *clack*

It squirms inside-like a worm in warm soil-**testing teeth, grooves, tension.**  
You sweat.  
Focus.  
Twist.

> *click... click...*  
> **CLUNK.**

The lock **jolts open.**

Not fully. Not yet.  
But the mechanism inside just **gave**.

**You're in.**

---

**üìù Status Update:**

- Kiwi Key = *Inserted successfully.*  
- Lock = **Engaged and partially compromised.**  
- You may now attempt to either **unlock it**, **break it from within**, or **let it weaken further before striking.**  
- Straw Hats = Watching with silent awe.  
- Tashigi = Eyes wide. You can tell-**you've surprised her.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Finish the unlocking. Twist the key fully. Let the cage fall open-or at least loosen the frame.}  
2. {Freeze. Let the juice *eat into* the mechanism longer. Let it corrode further. Patience.}  
3. {Back away and nod to Tashigi-"Now. One clean strike." Use the softened lock as a weak point.}  
4. {Break it from within. Swell the juice key. *Pop* the lock outward like a burst kiwi seed.}  
5. {Signal the Straw Hats-"Brace. Som</pre>
