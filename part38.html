<pre>e he believed in what we were doing."

She turns to Tashigi.

> "Even if it cost him."

---

And then there's **Luffy**-eyes still half-lidded, slumped in a makeshift bed of ropes and sacks. He hasn't said a word since waking up.

Until now.

He sits up. Slowly.

> "He's not dead."

Everyone looks at him.

Luffy scratches his head, looks toward the city, and shrugs with casual certainty.

> "Just feels like he's still moving."

**OOC Summary:**  
The Straw Hats are torn. They don't know who Eatone was-or *what* he was.  
- **Nami** suspects undercover Marine or government.  
- **Zoro** respects the fight and doesn't care about the label.  
- **Chopper** thinks he was cool.  
- **Vivi** is shaken, quietly reverent.  
- **Luffy**? Believes. No explanation. Just *feels it.*

They view him as someone who might've **sacrificed himself for them**-and whether that means they owe him, or that *he was one of them for a moment*, is something each is processing in their own way.

Would you like to **cut to Eatone's dramatic arrival now**, or let the Straw Hats linger in that uncertainty a little longer?

>> USER: Meanwhile at the camel. 

I pat the driver, telling him to let me off early. If someone sees me with him, he might get stuck on a kill list. I approach the dock stealthily (in case of watching Baroque agents), and notice that Tashigi looks absolutely miserable for some reason. Odd (I have no idea why)

OOC: Usopp and Sanji rendezvous with the other straw hats

OOC: Player character controls dislogue, may have window to respond to NPCs

>> ASSISTANT: **[Scene: Rainbase Docks - Moments Before the Crew's Departure]**  
**Tone: Calm Before the Next Storm | Mood: Tense, Quietly Hopeful**

---

**You pat the camel driver on the arm** before the final stretch, the dock now visible down a gently sloped street littered with crates, squawking gulls, and the occasional guard barking vague lockdown orders.

> "Let me off here."

The driver blinks. "But sir-"

> "If they spot you with me, you're gonna end up on a Warlord's kill list."

You hand him the promised triple fare-and a little extra.

> "Buy your camel something nice. Something not fermented."

He salutes you like he has *any* idea who you are, then clicks his tongue and fades into the backstreets like a good NPC who wants to live.

---

You slip down the alleyways-**stealth mode** activated not by training, but by sheer stress-based instinct.  
A couple of fruit crates provide cover. You duck behind a fish stand.  
You *blend in*-sort of.

> You reach the edge of the docks-just far enough to see the group boarding the ship.

And that's when you notice **Tashigi**.

---

**She's hunched forward**, half-sitting on a mooring post, gripping her sword like it's the only thing keeping her spine intact.  
Eyes distant.  
Face carved with something heavy.

> Guilt?

Weird.  
She got the princess out.  
The pirates are alive.  
She should be smug as hell.

> But she looks *wrecked.*

---

Up the dock, **Sanji and Usopp** come skidding into view, Sanji panting, Usopp wide-eyed and gesturing like he just fought twenty people off with a ladle.

> "There they are!" Usopp shouts. "I told you I knew where they'd be!"

Sanji ignores him.  
Looks to Nami first.  
Then Vivi.  
Then frowns.

> "Where's the pineapple guy?"

Nami opens her mouth to respond-  
But then Vivi's head **snaps up.**  
She looks out toward the side pier.

Right.  
Toward **you**.

---

You now have a **window to act.**

Do you approach openly?  
Sneak up behind them?  
Yell something stupid?  
Wait for Tashigi to notice you?

**You are in control.**  
What's your move?

>> USER: Huh. Seems like there's none of Croc's boys here, if they're all standing out in the open. Get up and jog over like nothing happened.

Ey, glad you made it out in one piece, petty officer. I do a small salute to Tashigi, and nod to Vivi. Princess.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Rainbase Docks - Reentry: Casual Mode Activated]**  
**Tone: Quiet Impact | Mood: Relief Drenched in Shock**  
**ðŸŽ² Crew Reaction Roll - (Tashigi +2 Emotional Guilt Spiral, -2 Unexpected Resurrection Shock) = 7 [Fantastic]**  
**ðŸŽ¯ Outcome: You land your casual reentry *perfectly*. The crew freezes. Tashigi turns, stunned. Vivi softens immediately. The Straw Hats are floored-and a moment that was wrapped in mourning turns into stunned, *breathless* joy.**

---

You jog across the dock like you're just catching up after grabbing a drink from the bar.

> "Ey, glad you made it out in one piece, Petty Officer."

You offer Tashigi a **small salute**-just enough formality to sting, just enough sarcasm to spark.

> "Princess."  
A short nod to Vivi. Crisp. Respectful. *Cordial Bounty Hunter mode: on.*

---

The effect is... **devastating.**

Tashigi **jerks upright** like someone yanked a live wire through her spine.  
She spins, eyes wide-just as **Vivi lets out a quiet gasp.**

> "You-"  
Tashigi starts, but the words die halfway.

She steps forward like she's going to hit you. Or hug you. Or yell at you.

> "You-You-You absolute-*moron!*"

She slaps your arm with the side of her fist, no force behind it.

> "You said you'd be right behind us!"

> "Yeah," you smirk. "Took the scenic route. Might've knocked over a vent. Bit of a citrus mess."

She stares at you.  
Blinks rapidly.  
Jaw tight.  
Eyes glassy.

Then turns around like she's looking for something to punch.

---

**Vivi**, on the other hand, simply steps forward and places her hand over yours.

> "You came back."

A statement. Not a question.  
You feel the **weight** in it, the knowledge that she's seen too many people *not* come back.

---

The Straw Hats are a mix of **shocked, smug, and openly relieved**:

- **Zoro** raises an eyebrow and nods. "Told you he wasn't dead."
- **Chopper** immediately hides behind a barrel and peeks out, sniffly: "I *knew* he was okay!"
- **Nami** crosses her arms, suspicious: "Alright, now I *really* want to know what your deal is."
- **Luffy**, from the rope pile, grins: "Smells like juice."

---

**Tashigi** finally turns back to you, jaw clenched.

> "You... jerk."

A beat. Then:

> "I'm... glad you're alive."

---

**You are fully reintegrated with the crew.**  
**Morale: Spiked.  
Tension: Broken.  
Reputation: Mysterious Hero, Fully Intact.**

---

**What would you like to say or do next?**  
This moment is **yours**.

>> USER: I frown at Tashigi. Would've been nice if you left me a map. I ended up running circles around the tunnels. Ended up exiting through the front door, somehow.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Rainbase Docks - The Citrus Cometh]**  
**Tone: Post-Tension Banter | Mood: Lightened, Awkward, Deeply Human**  
**ðŸŽ¯ Emotional Outcome: Connection. Bitterness softened. The guilt still lingers, but your words hit home-and Tashigi feels it.**

---

> "Would've been nice if you left me a map."

You say it with a frown-not angry, not accusatory, just... the truth, in that exhausted, *"you owe me a beer and maybe an apology"* tone of voice only a fellow adult can perfect.

> "I ended up running circles around the tunnels.  
Somehow exited through the *front door.* Like a damn customer."

The absurdity hangs in the air.

Tashigi stares at you, dumbfounded.

Then scoffs-one short, humorless laugh through her nose.

> "You *exited through the front?*"

> "Security barely blinked. You'd think a man dripping kiwi juice would get more questions."

Tashigi looks away, jaw clenched-then shakes her head with a rough breath. Her voice is low.

> "I thought you were dead."

She looks like she hates admitting it.  
Not because she's embarrassed.  
But because it *hurt*.

> "We made it to the upper floors. You never came.  
We reached the docks-still nothing.  
I thought... I'd left you to die for a mission."

A pause.

Then softer:

> "For me."

---

The group grows quiet again.

Vivi gently adjusts Luffy's straw hat where it's drooped over his eyes.

Zoro watches you both-then glances away like this conversation's too sharp to eavesd</pre>
