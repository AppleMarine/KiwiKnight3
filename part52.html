<body>
<pre>d **try to rise**.  
Elbows dig into the sand.  
Legs scream.  
Spine throbs with electric fire.

You get **half an inch** off the ground before your entire body **betrays you**.

> *WHUMP.*

Back down.  
Chest heaving.  
Juice clinging to your skin like sweat, thin and drying.

---

You groan-loud.  
Frustrated. Humiliated. Enraged.

> "Damn it-MOVE, damn you-!"

You want to fight.  
You want to shield her again.  
You want to matter.

But your **body won't let you.**

You can only **watch.**

---

**Vivi's still holding the line.**

But **barely.**

She's quick, light on her feet-but the slashers were never meant for drawn-out brawls. They're weapons of grace, not attrition.

- **Miss Merry Christmas** goes low, trying to tunnel under-Vivi counters by stabbing downward, forcing her back.  
- **Mr. 4** recovers from the rock hit, adjusting his aim. The dog barks. A cannonball clicks into place.

Vivi tries to reposition-

But she's **winded.**  
**Scraped.**  
**Alone.**

And **still fighting**.

---

**OOC: Your failed attempt to rise reflects your current state:  
- HP critically low  
- No physical actions possible without **outside help** or **immediate rest**  
- You can still influence the fight **indirectly** (juice-based, voice, insight)  
- Vivi is buffed by motivation but remains **outmatched in a 1v2**

Help is needed. **Soon.**

---

**From the horizon...**

You hear it.

A voice.  
A scream.

> "*Luffy!! Zoro!! There's another fight-over the riverbank!!*"

**Usopp.**  
And then:

> "I see smoke! That idiot teacher's still alive?! Move it!"

**Tashigi.**  
> "Oi! Vivi-!!"

**Sanji.**

---

They're coming.

But will they make it in time?

---

**What do you do?**

1. {Use your mist. Try to slow Miss Merry Christmas's tunneling, give Vivi warning.}  
2. {Call out to Vivi. "Left! Behind! Duck!" Direct her movements like a coach.}  
3. {Focus-conjure a puddle, try to send it sliding toward Mr. 4's cannon feet.}  
4. {Speak to the dog bazooka-maybe it's dumb enough to listen.}  
5. {Do nothing. Trust her. You've done all you can. Let the reinforcements come.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: â€‹Option 2 - try to call out a warning, but choke on blood. Vivi takes a hit.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - The Breaking Point]**  
**Scene: The Shout That Doesn't Come | Tone: Desperation | Mood: The First Crack in the Line**

---

You suck in a breath, trying to rise again, trying to speak-

> "Vi... *Vivi-left! Behind-*!"

But your voice catches.

Your throat contracts.

You **choke**.

> *KHHH-COUGH-*!

A mouthful of blood hits the sand with a **splat**, dark and metallic.  
Your body convulses.  
Your limbs shake.  
You can't breathe. Not right.

And in that half-second of silence-

> *Vivi misses your warning.*

---

**Miss Merry Christmas** bursts from the side-claws flashing in a tight arc.

Vivi turns **just a hair too slow**.

> *SLASH-!!*

A deep gash cuts across her right shoulder-her dominant arm.  
She stumbles back with a sharp cry, dropping one of her peacock rings as blood splatters into the sand.

> "*Agh-!*"

She doesn't fall.

But she **staggers**, clutching the wound, left side turned to shield it.

---

Miss Merry Christmas cackles, licking the sand off her claw.

> "You royals always get soft after the first cut!"

---

**Mr. 4's gun is locking on again.**

And now Vivi's slower.

---

You lie there, **fists trembling**, unable to shout, unable to move, your lungs trying to catch up with your will.

She's not down.

But you can see it:

> One more hit, and she might be.

---

**OOC Update:**

- Your attempted shout failed due to injury.  
- Vivi took a direct hit from Miss Merry Christmas.  
- Her dominant arm is now injured-reduced melee control.  
- She's still fighting, but **at serious disadvantage**.  
- Help is **moments away**, but not yet here.

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Force a whisper. Anything. "Sidestep... shield... swing..." Help her somehow.}  
2. {Focus on Mr. 4. Even from the ground, can you disrupt that next shot?}  
3. {Try to slide a kiwi mist warning across the sand toward her-direct tactile signal.}  
4. {Start crawling. Pain be damned. You'll throw yourself in front of the next blast if you have to.}  
5. {Pray. Not to gods. To kids. That they get here in time.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: â€‹Option 4 - I start crawling. Vivi sees the shot being lined up. She sees me crawling. But I won't get there in time. She won't be able to dodge in time either.

A moment passes...

OOC: give me a window to react

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - The Shot That Matters]**  
**Scene: The Longest Second**  
**Tone: Raw, Crawling Desperation | Mood: A Choice Between Two Lives**

---

The sun hangs like an executioner's blade.  
The sand burns your palms.  
Your ribs crack with every drag of your body forward.  
But you crawl.

You crawl **anyway.**

---

Mr. 4 is locked on.

> The dog bazooka's mouth gapes open.  
> Smoke swirls in its throat.  
> The cannonball gleams-ready to be born.

And **Vivi**, bloodied, arm limp at her side, turns her head.

> She sees you.

Dragging yourself toward her.

Barely breathing.  
Already broken.

> And she sees **the shot** lining up.

Knows she won't be fast enough.  
Knows you won't reach her in time.  
Knows what will happen if **no one moves.**

---

A moment passes.

---

Your eyes meet hers.

You feel it in her gaze.

> She's deciding.

---

**You may now react.  
What do you do?**

>> USER: â€‹OOC: what are Vivi's thoughts in this moment

>> ASSISTANT: **[Vivi's Internal Monologue - The Longest Second]**  
**Setting: Sandora River, Seconds Before Impact**  
**Mood: Time-Split Terror | Tone: Heartbeat Between Duty and Choice**

---

> *I can't move fast enough.*  
> *He won't reach me in time.*  
> *The shot is coming.*

---

She feels her pulse thunder in her ears, drowning out the cackling of Miss Merry Christmas, the bark of the cannon-dog, the screaming wind.  
All of it fades to the sound of her **heartbeat**-

And the sight of **you**.

> **Crawling**.  
> Bleeding.  
> Broken.  
> Still trying to get to her.  
> Again.

---

> *He's not even from Alabasta...*

The thought cuts deep.

> *He's a teacher. A bounty hunter. A civilian.  
He came here on vacation. He's not supposed to die for me.*

But then-

> *Neither am I supposed to watch him die for nothing.*

She sees your eyes-widened, not pleading, but **commanding**.

Telling her: *Don't you dare.*

> *I can't let him die again.*

But she can't move fast enough.

And if she jumps in front of the shot?

> She might die.  
> But if she stays still?

> *He dies.*

---

**She decides.**

> *It's my kingdom.*  
> *It's my war.*  
> *He's already given everything. It's my turn.*

---

The moment stretches...

> **And she moves.**

---

**OOC: Vivi is about to make her move-**  
But you have a window to act, call out, or override her if you wish.

What do you do?

>> USER: â€‹OOC: the straw hats are finishing their fights, when they notice a pair baroque agents have slipped past and are overwhelming Vivi and the schoolteacher

Tashigi, too far to help, sees Vivi, caught off her footing, about to be swiped by one agent, and shot by the other. 

Tashigi then sees me. Burned, bloody, beaten. But with a desperate look in my eyes, still crawling, still trying to protect her.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - The Moment That Breaks Through]**  
**Scene: Witnessed by Justice | Tone: Fracture and Fury | Mood: Powerless Realization**

---

From the far ridge, **Tashigi** breaks through the last of the footsoldiers-her blade bloody, her breath ragged.

She turns-  
And sees it.

---

**Vivi.**  
One arm limp.  
Blood running down her shoulder.  
Out of position.

**Miss Merry Christmas** is lunging for her side with claws outstretched.  
**Mr. 4's** dog is mid-bark, cannonball chambered, barrel aimed square at her center.

---

And then-

She sees **you**.

---

Down on your chest, **dragging yourself forward.**  
Your back *</pre>
