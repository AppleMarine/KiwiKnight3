<pre>eping low against the storm of confusion and smoke.

**Vivi rides forward**, eyes scanning the rooftops, her jaw tight. Her cloak flutters behind her-half-princess, half-soldier.

> "We have to stop the fighting *now*," she says, urgency leaking into her voice.

---

Behind you, **Tashigi and the Straw Hats** are spread across several ducks, weapons at the ready:

- **Zoro**, eyes narrowed, scanning rooftops.  
- **Sanji**, already lighting a cigarette, muttering, "This place is going to hell."  
- **Nami**, riding beside Chopper, eyes flicking across the terrain like she's drawing a mental map.  
- **Usopp** is reloading. Everything.  
- **Luffy**, crouched low on the front of his duck, doesn't speak. He's focused. Too focused.  
> He can **feel** something. Probably *him*.

---

> "Where's Crocodile?" Tashigi mutters under her breath.

You glance toward her, pain still in your side, **baton resting on your lap** like a coiled principle.

> "Shouldn't he be here? If he thinks we're dead..."

Vivi shakes her head.

> "If he *thinks* that, he's not here to lead the rebels. That means..."

You all look up toward the highest point in Alubarna.

The **palace.**

---

**OOC: Current Situation and Status**

- **Crocodile**, accompanied by **Miss All Sunday**, has likely slipped away during the chaos to seek the **Poneglyph** beneath the palace.  
  - He believes Vivi and the Straw Hats are **dead**, and the war is already won.  
  - He carries **King Cobra** as prisoner, both trophy and key.

- The **main battle** is between the **royal army and rebel forces**, clashing violently across Alubarna's districts.

- **Vivi's goal** is to reach the rebel leader **Kohza** and **stop the fighting**, to prevent further bloodshed and keep Crocodile's true plot from succeeding.

- **You and Tashigi** now serve as the only **non-pirate adults** in a position of authority to possibly back her-militarily, morally, and strategically.

- **Smoker's status:** Unknown. If Miss All Sunday set a timer to his escape, it could align with the climax... or not.

**Your Ducks have dismounted.**  
The crew stands in a city courtyard-rooftops overhead, streets stretching in every direction.  
Vivi turns to you and Tashigi, voice sharp:

> "We split here. If Crocodile's not in the city... he's under it."

> "We'll find Kohza. Stop the war."

> "But we need someone to find the palace."

She looks between you and Tashigi.

> "We're out of time."

---

**OOC: You may now choose your next move.**

1. {Stay with Vivi. Her safety and the rebellion's end are your priority.}  
2. {Volunteer to head to the palace with Tashigi. If Cobra's alive, someone needs to save him.}  
3. {Suggest a detour to try intercepting Crocodile directly. It's risky.}  
4. {Split from all of them and recon from the rooftops-gather intel.}  
5. {Argue: "No more splitting up. We end this together."}

ðŸŒ€ What do you choose?

>> USER: To Tashigi: â€‹Hold on. Palace? Why would Crocodile be heading to the palace, much less be under it, Tashigi-chan?

Also how the hell are you going to stop a war by yourself, blue?

OOC; they may have discussed plans/Intel while I was unconscious

The moment Vivi drops the word "palace," your eyes cut to **Tashigi**.

> "*Hold on.*"

You straighten as much as your aching spine allows and point sharply at her like you're about to grade her on a pop quiz she didn't study for.

> "*Palace?* Why the hell would Crocodile be heading there, *much less be under it*, Tashigi-chan?"

Tashigi winces slightly at the suffix-less from offense, more from the *tone*.

She turns to you, walking as the group keeps pace through the smoke-filled plaza.

---

> "There's a historical record. A legend. A Poneglyph-some kind of ancient tablet-buried beneath the palace."

> "Miss All Sunday is an archaeologist. Smart money says she's the only one who can read it."

She adjusts her glasses, tone clipped.

> "He doesn't want Alabasta. He wants what's *hidden* in Alabasta."

> "Power. Weapon. Knowledge. All of the above. The usual Warlord ambition grab bag."

---

You turn to **Vivi**, still striding at the front of the group, one hand on her peacock slasher, the other gripping the folds of her cloak.

> "Also, how the hell are you going to stop a war by yourself, *Blue?*"

---

She doesn't slow.  
But she does answer.

> "Kohza will listen to me."

Her voice is steady. Conviction in every syllable.

> "If I can reach him. If he knows the truth-that Crocodile caused the drought, the rebellion, *everything*-he'll call off the attack."

She stops at the corner of a ruined fountain and looks back at you.

> "I don't need to win a fight. I just need to say the right thing."

---

The ground rumbles faintly from another explosion blocks away.

Time is bleeding fast.

---

Tashigi meets your gaze again. She's tense-but *calculated*.

> "If you can walk, Cheng-sensei... I'm heading to the palace."

> "And I'd rather not deal with Crocodile alone."

---

Vivi turns to you as well now. Less commanding, more...

Hopeful.

> "I trust you. You'll make the right call."

---

**OOC: Info Recap:**
- While you were unconscious, **Tashigi and Vivi shared intel**:
  - Crocodile seeks a **Poneglyph under the palace**, not just the throne.
  - **Miss All Sunday (Robin)** can read it.
  - **King Cobra** is believed to be captured and taken there.
- **Vivi's plan:** Find **Kohza**, stop the war through truth.
- **Tashigi's plan:** Go to the palace, intercept Crocodile and rescue Cobra.
- **Straw Hats:** Will scatter to draw out remaining Baroque agents.

**What do you do?**

1. {Stick with Vivi. She'll need someone grounded when words fail.}  
2. {Go with Tashigi. Crocodile is the head of the beast.}  
3. {Try to delay both plans-push for regrouping, slower advance. Risky.}  
4. {Insist on going solo to scout ahead, possibly to the palace or rooftops.}  
5. {Make them flip a coin. Because that's the kind of day this is.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your path.}

>> USER: Hold on. Poneglyphs.. isn't that the super illegal thing? The World Government unpersons you if you even catch a peek of it thing? Also who's Kohza?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Questions No One Wanted Asked Right Now]**  
**Scene: "Forbidden Knowledge, Forgotten Friends"**  
**Tone: Blunt Curiosity | Mood: â€˜Why Are We In This Deep?'**

---

You hold up a hand as if to **literally pause the oncoming war**.

> "*Hold on.*"

Your voice slices through the chaos like chalk on a blackboard mid-lecture.

You point vaguely at the sand-choked skyline, then at Tashigi, then at **everybody**.

> "Poneglyphs."

> "You mean *those* poneglyphs? The â€˜World Government will erase you from history if you so much as sneeze on them' poneglyphs?"

> "We're waltzing into the *capital* of a kingdom where one is supposedly buried under the **palace**-with a Warlord, an outlaw archaeologist, *and a bunch of kids with wanted posters*-and I'm just finding this out *now?!*"

---

Tashigi's eye twitches.

> "Yes."

> "It's classified."

She clears her throat, not making eye contact.

> "And you were unconscious."

---

You slowly turn to **Vivi**, narrowing your eyes.

> "Also-who the hell is Kohza? Am I supposed to know that name? Is he a warlord too? A fruit guy? A cousin?"

---

Vivi blinks, almost startled by the question. Then-finally-**smiles faintly**, despite everything.

> "He's my childhood friend."

She says it like it's the most obvious thing in the world. Like you're supposed to have gotten the entire government dossier through osmosis.

> "We grew up together. He's the leader of the rebel army now."

> "But he's not a bad person. He wants to save the country too."

She looks ahead, eyes locked on the rising palace above the distant rooftops.

> "Crocodile manipulated him. Made him believe we were the enemy."
