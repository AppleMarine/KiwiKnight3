<pre>* A tiny bit.  
Just enough.

She splashes it on your chest. **Cold.**  
A shock to the system.

---

**Tashigi follows suit.**

Unbuttons your coat, presses her hand firmly to your sternum.

> "Stimulus. Pain triggers. Anything we can."

She pulls her glove off and **pinches your side hard.**

> "Get up. You *idiot*. You beautiful, stubborn, terrified idiot-"

---

**Vivi leans forward again, lowering her voice.**

> "Snack Pack would've wanted you to see the next race."

> "And I think... I think I would too."

---

**Above-**

The Elemental sways.

A faint pulse from its chest.

The **dim light flickers**.

Waiting.

---

**OOC:**  
All three methods have been deployed:

- **Emotional Plea (Vivi)**  
- **Physical Stimulus (Tashigi)**  
- **Unorthodox Combined Trigger (Water + Pressure + Memory)**

You may now:

1. {Respond to one, with partial consciousness.}  
2. {Respond to multiple. Fragmented. Slurred.}  
3. {Stay quiet. Let the dice roll.}

>> USER: ​Not quiet yet. Nothing

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - Pulse Flatline, Hope Holding]**  
**Scene: "The Unmoving Man"**  
**Tone: Collapsing | Mood: The Quiet Before the Breath**

---

Tashigi's slap rings out across the plaza.

The splash of water on your chest beads and rolls down.

Vivi's fingers tighten around your hand until her own go white.

The air is charged-alive with *trying*.

But you?

You're still.

---

No twitch.  
No breath change.  
No flicker behind your eyelids.

You're a **statue in pulp-stained clothes**, as motionless as the Elemental you birthed.

---

Tashigi bites back a curse, leaning down, forehead against yours.

> "You *absolute bastard*... Don't you dare do this to her. Or to me."

---

Vivi's voice begins to crack.

> "Please... Just... Just wake up."

> "We've come so far. We're *right here*. I need-"

She chokes on the last word. Doesn't finish it.

---

**Above-**

The Elemental groans.

A deep, whale-like reverberation of confusion and loss.

It doesn't collapse.

But it lowers its fists.

It doesn't protect.

But it doesn't leave.

It **waits.**

---

**Crocodile laughs.**

> "There it is."

> "The limits of sentimentality."

---

The sandstorm around him tightens.

Luffy stumbles.  
His legs buckling.  
The final round drawing near.

---

And still-

You lie there.

Unmoving.

Unbreathing.

Unyielding...?

---

**OOC:**

You remain **completely unresponsive.**  
The Elemental is **not dispersing**-but fully inert.

Vivi and Tashigi are now at the brink of collapse, physically and emotionally.  
The **next trigger** must be something beyond them.

Another voice.

Another presence.

Or the final roll of fate itself.

Scene pending.

>> USER: Continue Vivi and Tashigi's scene

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Girls and the Ghost]**  
**Scene: "He's Still In There"**  
**Tone: Emotional Exhaustion | Mood: Guilt, Grief, and Defiance**

---

**Tashigi** remains hunched over you, one hand braced on your chest, the other cradling your head as if physical contact could force a heartbeat. Her expression is taut-**trained Marine composure shredded**, replaced by bare, unshielded pain.

> "He's gone," she whispers-**and it isn't a statement.**

It's a **threat** to the world.  
A **dare** to the universe to prove her wrong.

---

**Vivi** stares at you with wide, desperate eyes, **her hands trembling in her lap**. Her breath stutters, chest rising and falling, **caught somewhere between fury and heartbreak.**

She's lost so many people.

She told herself she wouldn't lose anyone else.

Not him.

---

> "You're not supposed to go yet," she says, barely audible.

She clutches your hand tighter, even as your fingers remain limp in hers.

> "You told me I wasn't alone. You told me someone would help carry this."

> "You told me the *kids* shouldn't carry it..."

A sob slips through her voice.

> "Then why are you making me?"

---

Tashigi leans closer to you, her forehead resting against your bruised temple.

Her tone softens.  
It's not a Marine's bark now.

It's a **friend's whisper**.

> "You jumped in front of me in the hallway. You dragged yourself across the palace floor."

> "You summoned a god out of *juice*."

A choked laugh escapes her lips-**not humor. Shock. Grief.**

> "You did all that, and you're seriously going to quit *now*?"

---

No answer.

No movement.

---

The wind kicks up around them-**grit and sand flurrying** across the plaza.

The storm above is **closing in**.

The Elemental stands, wavering like a candle wick moments before it gutters out.

---

Vivi wipes her eyes roughly, furious at herself, and sets her jaw.

> "Fine."

She leans in, lips close to your ear, and says it:

> "I'm not letting you die, Sensei."

> "Because if you do... I swear I'll find a way to *drag you back* myself."

---

Tashigi smirks through clenched teeth.

> "And I'll *kick your ass* if she doesn't."

---

The two women sit with you-still.  
Refusing to leave.  
Refusing to **let go**.

---

Above...

**Crocodile draws his arm back.**

A jagged spiral of sand winds around his wrist like a hungry serpent, forming a weapon sharp enough to split stone.

He **locks eyes with Luffy**, and speaks with pure venom.

> "Let's end this farce."

---

The sky **darkens.**

The **crowd screams.**

And your girls?

They don't move.

They **just hold on.**

---

**OOC:**

Vivi and Tashigi's scene reaches its **emotional peak**-both refusing to accept your death.

Their voices may have seeded something.

The world is **moments** from collapse.

If anything is to awaken in you-it must be **now**, or never.

>> USER: ​Meanwhile... In my barely conscious state.

Darkness. something, maybe multiple somethings soft, seem to be pressing at me. Occasionally slapping and pinching me, too. Odd.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Inside the Mind - The Half-Drowned Classroom]**  
**Scene: "Tactile Learning"**  
**Tone: Surreal | Mood: Comedic Confusion Wrapped in Trauma**

---

**Darkness.**

Not the peaceful kind.  
Not velvet or gentle or womb-like.

This is the **buzzing black** of a mind short-circuiting.  
A half-lit classroom during a power outage.  
A **suspended awareness**, drifting somewhere between detention and death.

---

You float.

No, you're grounded.

Wait-are you sitting?

Lying?

Your body's somewhere, but your brain **doesn't have the blueprints anymore**.

---

What you *do* have is sensation.

Weird, illogical, very **soft**, very **invasive sensation**.

---

Something's **pressing against your face.**  
Something warm, like a hand.  
Or two.  
Or maybe a **lap?**

Also-

> *slap.*

Then-

> *pinch.*

Then-**a hand shaking your collar.**

---

You mumble in the darkness:

> "Wh... why am I in a beanbag chair... made of disappointment..."

Your mouth is dry.  
Your lips are forming syllables you don't quite understand.

> "Who keeps slapping me...?"  
> "Stop pinching me, I'll finish the worksheets..."

---

Somewhere in your mind, an echo of **Vivi's voice**, distorted like a radio underwater:

> "...need you..."

Then Tashigi's:

> "...kick your ass..."

Another slap.

Definitely a **Marine slap.** You can tell by the discipline.

---

You float.

Your thoughts fragment into driftwood:

- **Snack Pack, in a graduation cap.**  
- **A chalkboard with "JUST BREATHE" scribbled on it.**  
- **A test. Multiple choice. The last question is "Live or Die?"**  
  - You've circled "C) Nap."

---

Another slap.

Another **pinch**.

Something grabs your ear like a teacher scolding a teacher.

---

> "I'm... going to give you all zeroes if you don't stop touching me..."

---

Your fingers twitch.

One, then two.

A flicker behind your eyes.

A *stirring*.

Not awake.

But *stirring.*

---

**OOC:**
You remain comatose-but **tactile stimulation is breaking through** the void.

Vivi and Tashigi's **physical contact** is piercing the mental fog.

You may now:

1. {Let out a groan or slurred word. A moment of lucidity.}  
2. {Physically react-small twitch, breath, anything.}  
3. {Mentally begin to</pre>
