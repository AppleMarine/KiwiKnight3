<pre>vi and Tashigi as the desert wind brushes past, carrying the scent of sun-warmed sand, citrus, and the faint notes of salt from the distant sea. The sun climbs higher. Shadows stretch long behind you.

Ahead, the **Straw Hats** are nearly ready to board.

---

**Vivi steps forward**, her white cloak fluttering at the edges, the royal crest embroidered in pale gold across her shoulders.

She stops just before them.

**They all turn.**

And the noise stills.

Even **Luffy** looks serious now.

---

She draws a deep breath.

> "I... I knew from the beginning that I wouldn't be able to stay with you."

Her voice doesn't crack.

Not this time.

> "But that didn't stop me from dreaming about it."

She looks to each of them, eyes shimmering-but she keeps smiling.

> "You gave me strength. You made me believe again. You saved this kingdom."

> "But I have to stay."

> "Because I *am* this kingdom."

---

No one speaks.

No one *has* to.

Because every Straw Hat is listening **with their whole heart**.

Even **Zoro**, eyes closed, jaw tight.

Even **Sanji**, blinking fast.

Even **Usopp**, already tearing up like someone broke a faucet behind his goggles.

---

She looks down for a moment, then up again.

> "I'll always consider you my friends."

> "And I hope..."

> "I hope one day, when the world is kinder-when I can travel without fear-"

> "I'll find you again."

---

She raises her hand.

Two fingers crossed.

**The mark of a Straw Hat crew bond.**

---

And across the ship, one by one, **they raise their arms in silence**.

All seven of them.

Every fist in the air.

---

And for a moment, the world holds its breath.

---

**You stand behind her**, watching this moment unfold.

You're not a pirate.

Not royalty.

Not a Marine.

Just a man who knows what it means to say goodbye to children **you helped grow up**, even if only for a little while.

You feel that ache in your chest again.

The same one you felt in the palace.

But this time?

**It's not from injury.**

---

**Tashigi**, beside you, is quiet.

Not unmoved.

Just giving them their space.

Just letting the girl say her piece, **as a princess and as a friend.**

---

The crowd stays silent.

Even the guards don't speak.

The Going Merry rocks softly, ready to go.

---

**OOC:**
- This was Vivi's goodbye-true, final, brave.
- The Straw Hats understand.
- The moment is yours, now. If you wish to step forward, you can.

Would you like to:

1. {Say your own farewell to the crew.}
2. {Speak privately to one Straw Hat (choose).}
3. {Hang back. Quietly observe, then leave.}

>> USER: ​Option 2 - Oi, straw boy. Say ahhh-

Wait for his reaction

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna City Gates - A Teacher's Goodbye]**  
**Scene: "One Last Lesson"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Playful | Mood: Heartfelt, Humorous, Laced with Real Respect**

---

The crew still stands with fists raised, the wind tugging at their coats, cloaks, and hair.

Vivi's gaze lingers on them, not quite ready to turn away-

And you?

You finally step forward.

No ceremony.

No grand entrance.

Just a voice.

Dry. Familiar. **Yours.**

---

> "Oi, Straw Boy."

Luffy turns, slowly, blinking like he didn't expect to hear you.

---

You raise one arm, a small glint of green already forming in your palm.

> "Say *ahhh-*"

---

He grins like a kid at recess.

> "AHHHHH!"

---

*PFFFSSHT!*

A perfect arc of **sweet golden kiwi juice** hits him square in the mouth.

He throws both arms in the air like he just won a prizefight.

> "YEAHHH! That's the GOOD stuff!"

---

**Sanji** smirks from the side, cigarette dangling from his lips.

> "You're gonna rot his teeth before he even makes it back to the Grand Line."

---

**Zoro**, arms crossed:

> "Didn't think you were sentimental."

---

You shrug, casually.

> "I'm not."

A beat.

Then softer.

> "But he kept my kids safe. I owe him that much."

---

**Chopper's ears twitch.**  
**Usopp's lip wobbles.**  
**Nami's smile is real, but tired.**

---

Luffy walks toward you a few steps.

Still chewing.

Then offers a hand-sticky, cheerful, **full of sincerity.**

> "You're a weird guy."

> "But you're a good guy."

---

You take it.

Grip firm.

> "Don't let the world chew you up, Straw Boy."

You nod toward his crew.

> "They need you upright."

---

Luffy grins wider.

> "Nah, they'll be fine."

> "But I'm still gonna punch anyone who messes with them."

---

He releases your hand.

Turns.

Heads back toward the ship.

---

You stand still, watching them load, one by one.

You may never see them again.

But you'll remember the lesson.

And **so will they.**

---

**OOC:**
- You said goodbye to Luffy in your own way-dry, sincere, flavored with fruit.
- You've left a lasting impression on him-and the crew.
- They respect you. You mattered to them.

Would you like to:

1. {Say one last thing to the group before they go.}  
2. {Return to Vivi and Tashigi-walk away together.}  
3. {Speak privately to one other Straw Hat (choose).}

>> USER: ​Option 2 - watch then set sail, then return to the palace. Might run into Smoker.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna City Gates - The Departure]**  
**Scene: "The Ones Who Keep Walking"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Quiet | Mood: Satisfying, Gentle, and Forward-Looking**

---

You stay just long enough to see the **Going Merry** catch the wind.

The oars beat.

The sails bloom.

The crew waves once more-wild and free and loud-and just like that, **they're gone**.

Heading back into the Grand Line.

---

You don't wave.

You just watch.

A teacher to the end.

Watching his students leave the classroom for the last time.

---

**Vivi watches too.** Silent now. Her hands clasped in front of her, trembling slightly.

**Tashigi** gives you a quiet nod as the ship vanishes behind a soft curve of canyon and light.

> "They'll be alright," she says, mostly to herself.

> "Somehow."

---

You turn from the gate.

Time to walk back.

Your body complains.

But your soul?

Your soul is lighter.

---

---

**[Palace Steps - Early Afternoon]**  
**Scene: "Smoke Signals"**  
**POV: You**

---

The guards nod you in, not even questioning your limp or the pineapple-scented aura you still carry.

You make it halfway up the steps when you hear-

> "So."

The voice is low, gravely, familiar.

> "You're the reason this place smells like juice for the next three decades."

---

**Smoker** leans against a scorched column at the top of the stairs, coat flared open, two cigars burning at once like twin engines of judgment.

He looks at you.

Really looks.

Not just assessing your limp, your bandages, your haggard face-

But **who you are now**.

What you've become.

---

> "Not bad... for a schoolteacher."

---

Would you like to:

1. {Greet Smoker properly - no fear, no shame.}  
2. {Deflect with humor. You've been through worse.}  
3. {Ask if you're under arrest. Half-seriously.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 / 3 - Salute the Captain. Captain Smoker. Glad to see you alright. Saw you take a few from the Croc. Thanks for the assist.

...I'm not under arrest or anything, right?

OOC: give me a window to respond to dialogue

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Steps - Under Smoky Scrutiny]**  
**Scene: "Teacher. Civilian. Hero."**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Formal | Mood: Tense, Dryly Cordial, Laced with Mutual Respect**

---

You straighten up as best you can, shift your weight off your worse leg, and lift your hand into a crisp, respectful salute.

**Not sloppy.**  
Not mocking.  
**Not submissive.**

Just... *correct.*

> "Captain Smoker."

> "Glad to see you alright."

A faint smile touches your lips.

> "Saw you take a few from the Croc. Thanks for the assist."

---

**Smoker's brows twitch upward**-not in surprise at the tone, but at the *fact* you used it.

He puffs his cigars slowly, letting silence settle between you.

---

You hold the pause, then add-more carefully:

> "...I'm not under arrest or anything, right?"

You say it as lightly as you can.

But your eyes don't leave his.

---

**Smoker exhales. Long. Slow. </pre>
