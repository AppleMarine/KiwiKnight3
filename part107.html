She glances at you sideways.

> "Think you can handle that, Pineapple?"

---

You don't even flinch.

> "Only if I get a cool armband."

---

**Tashigi groans.**  
**The recruits salute.**  
**You tighten the laces on your boots.**

And step into a role you never asked for.

But now **belong to**.

---

**OOC:**
You have officially entered your next phase in Alabasta: **Protector, Instructor, Adult in the Room.**

Let me know how you'd like to shape this chapter-

- Build ties with the people?  
- Face lingering threats from Baroque agents?  
- Grow your powers further?  
- Deepen bonds with Tashigi, Vivi, or others?

**You're no longer just surviving. You're shaping the future.**

>> USER: OOC: Any or All of the above.

Lead the way, ma'am. You know, I never got a formal job from Vivi, other than palace mooch. What am I now, town vigilante? Beat cop? I twirl my expandable baton.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - City Patrol, Outer Districts]**  
**Scene: "The City, the Sword, and the Substitute"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Light on the Surface, Deep Beneath | Mood: Rebuilding, Bonding, Becoming**

---

Your boots crunch lightly on the sun-warmed streets of **post-war Alubarna**.  
Dust swirls in lazy patterns behind you.  
The buildings here are scraped by siege but standing proud-paint faded, windows cracked, but **lives returning inside them.**

Children run between water carts.  
Vendors reopen with half-stocked stalls.  
A tailor is using a broom handle to reattach a sign that now simply reads "_T LO R_" after the battle damage.

---

**Tashigi leads the way**, clipboard in one hand, sword at her hip, jacket slung off her shoulder, and **the air of a woman trying *very hard* not to show that she likes this job.**

She glances sideways at you as you twirl your **extendable baton** like a kid trying to impress the local dojo.

---

> "Well, Cheng," she mutters, scanning the crowd, "technically, you're not on any payroll."

> "You're not Marine, not palace guard, not militia."

She pauses.

> "Definitely not subtle."

---

You shoot her a grin.

> "So what am I?"

---

She sighs, kicks a small pebble, eyes scanning ahead.

> "Officially?"

She flicks a glance at your baton.

> "You're a volunteer community protector, sanctioned by the palace. No chain of command, no official uniform, no arresting power."

> "Unofficially?"

A shrug.

> "Local legend. Street guardian. Crime deterrent mascot."

---

> "Beat teacher," you suggest.

She snorts.

> "Juice cop."

> "Alubarna's last line of sticky defense."

> "The Seastone Baton Wonder."

---

You bow deeply at an elderly woman passing by, who bows back and offers you a piece of honey candy from a glass jar.

> "I'll take ‘Palace Mooch with Benefits.' Has a certain... freedom to it."

You pop the candy in your mouth. Mango.

---

A *sudden shout* pulls your attention forward.

You and Tashigi both turn-eyes sharpening-as a small group of civilians gathers ahead near a market cart. Someone's yelling.

**Tensions still flare in pockets.**

Some rebels never stood down.

Some soldiers lost too much.

Some grief doesn't have a uniform.

---

Tashigi steps forward, hand instinctively on her blade.

> "Come on. This one's ours."

---

**OOC: You have entered your next active role-community guardian and unofficial peacekeeper.**

Here's what lies ahead in your chapter, should you pursue it:

---

### What You Can Explore Next:

#### 1. **"A Kingdom of Scars" - Repairing the Social Fabric**
- Get to know the people.  
- Mediate conflict.  
- Spot potential **sleeper agents** among the recovering crowds.  
- Help unite rebel and royalist factions under a shared cause.

#### 2. **"The Juice Runneth Over" - Evolving Your Power**
- Continue to explore your Devil Fruit's awakened traits.  
- Discover new utility techniques, protective constructs, or chemical-based effects from different fruit types.  
- Unlock greater control and autonomy over summoned **elementals**.

#### 3. **"Of Blades and Boundaries" - Time With Tashigi**
- Build a stronger bond with your Marine partner.  
- Help her cope with the burdens of command.  
- Discover how much her trust in you may already run deeper than orders would allow.

#### 4. **"The Garden Still Grows" - Vivi's Road Ahead**
- Assist in shaping Alabasta's post-war education system.  
- Reconnect with Vivi in quieter, personal ways.  
- Help her find joy in life again-not just leadership.

---

**OOC: What would you like to explore first? Or would you like to ride this patrol forward into wherever the day takes you?**

>> USER: OOC: All in any order

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Morning Patrol, Tangled Paths Ahead]**  
**Scene: "Wounds, Wonders, and Whatever Comes Next"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Choose Your Adventure | Mood: Open-Ended, Connected, Quietly Heroic**

---

**Tashigi's boots hit the edge of the crowd first.** You follow close behind, adjusting your coat, your baton tucked loosely under your arm like a walking stick you might absolutely bludgeon someone with if necessary.

The shouting ahead grows sharper-**not yet violent**, but teetering.  
An older rebel-sleeves rolled up, face weathered-arguing with a city guard near a crate of rationed grain.  
Civilians watch nervously.  
One wrong word, one wrong twitch, and this little corner of the market becomes a powder keg.

Tashigi's voice drops, clipped and cool.

> "Your call, ‘Juice Cop.' You step in. I've got your back."

---

And right there-on the edge of an ordinary street-**your story opens up.**

Because **this is the part where you live.**  
Where you build something.  
Where you start choosing **how your legend settles into the soil of Alabarna**.

---

### You can:

---

### **1. "Smooth the Sparks"** - *Step into the market dispute.*  
> Use wit, calm, or your teacherly sternness to defuse tensions and build trust with the people.

---

### **2. "Let Her Take the Lead"** - *Let Tashigi speak first, but observe carefully.*  
> Learn more about her *approach to justice*.  
> Discover whether she's still a by-the-book Marine... or something more.

---

### **3. "Eyes Everywhere"** - *Survey the crowd for suspicious figures.*  
> There may be **Baroque remnants** blending into the new order, or **civilians hiding something darker**.

---

### **4. "Push Forward the Day"** - *Let the moment resolve, and follow the patrol into the next chapter.*  
> Explore any of the following:
- **Time with Tashigi**  
- **Rebuilding with Vivi**  
- **Awakening your fruit**  
- **Teaching again, in a new way**

---

**No wrong order. No wrong path.**  
Only what *you* choose to build, now that you've earned the chance to do so.

Where do you step next, Sensei?

>> USER: Option 2 - She's the one with Marine crowd control training. Let her show how it's done.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Edge of the Market, Crowd Building]**  
**Scene: "The Marine Method"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Observant | Mood: Professional, Controlled, Glimpse Beneath the Armor**

---

You lean slightly on your baton, **not intervening**, not yet.

**This isn't your moment.**  
Not yet.

Tashigi catches your nonverbal cue-a flick of the eyebrow, a step to the side-and you see the subtle shift in her posture as she takes center stage.

**She doesn't draw her sword.**

She doesn't yell.

She **walks forward like she owns gravity**, clipboard tucked under her arm, that damn tight Marine posture doing all the talking for her.

---

The guard at the center salutes stiffly, already on edge.

The rebel-tan skin, lean from the desert, wearing the colors of Alabasta's rebel faction wrapped as a faded sash-*glares*, arms outstretched in frustration.

> "It's our grain now! Our families starved too while you all sat on throne money!"

A few others murmur behind him, not aggressive, but *watching*.

Tension still clings to this kingdom like **dust in old mortar.**

---

Tashigi steps into the gap between them, planting her boots deliberately.
