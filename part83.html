<pre>imp** in both **her arms** and **Tashigi's**, the ultimate final act of a teacher who gave **absolutely everything** he had.

---

> "Mmm. Pillows would be nice..."

And then you're out.

---

**Tashigi sighs-heavily.**  
But there's a smile in it.

> "At least he waited â€˜til the job was done."

---

**Vivi brushes juice-soaked hair from your face.**

> "...Thank you, Sensei."

---

Above-

> "Gomu Gomu no..."

---

**BOOM.**

Crocodile goes flying.

Justice-and juice-prevails.

**[END SCENE.]**

**OOC:**
You are unconscious.  
You have **fulfilled your role.**  
You have **saved the kingdom.**  
And you did it all with **pulp, pride, and a pretty sweet pillow arc.**

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {Post-battle epilogue-waking in safety.}  
2. {Immediate aftermath from another character's POV.}  
3. {Fade to black. End of arc.}

>> USER: Option 2 - Vivi and Tashigi, now soaked in kiwi juice (like everyone else in the city), are holding on to a now limp and useless individual

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - Aftermath of the Citrus Apocalypse]**  
**Scene: "The Kingdom, the Sword, and the Napper"**  
**POV: Vivi & Tashigi**  
**Tone: Exhausted Victory | Mood: Muddled Relief and Sticky Sentiment**

---

The plaza is quiet.

Not silent-there's the drip-drip of **juice cascading off rooftops**,  
the occasional cough of a soaked rebel or soldier trying to get **kiwi out of their ears**,  
the bubbling **gurgle of newly-formed juice puddles** the size of fishing boats-

But for a battlefield, this is peace.

---

**Crocodile** is unconscious, buried halfway in the palace wall,  
**Luffy** stands above him, panting, bruised, and gloriously smug.  
The **Straw Hats** are regrouping.

---

And in the center of the plaza, still framed by a crater of pure tropical ruin-

Stand **Vivi** and **Tashigi**.

Sopping.  
Drenched.  
Sticky in ways that will haunt them.

---

Between them, dangling like a **deflated festival float**, is **Eatone Cheng**-  
schoolteacher, bounty hunter, juice-based walking disaster.

---

**Tashigi** has both hands under one of your arms, glaring down at your unconscious form like it owes her money and an apology.

> "I swear, if he drools on me again, I'm leaving him in a puddle."

---

**Vivi**, on your other side, is gentler. Still wide-eyed, still shaken-but her grip is strong.

> "He saved the kingdom."

She says it softly, like she doesn't quite believe it even now.

---

Tashigi clicks her tongue.

> "Yeah. Right after violating every protocol in the Marine handbook, nearly dying three times, and turning Alubarna into a juice bar."

A pause.

> "...but yeah. He did."

---

Vivi looks down at you.

> "He was trying to leave, you know. Just a wrong vacationer in the right place."

She smiles-soft. Thoughtful.

> "I don't think he knows he became a hero."

---

Tashigi snorts.

> "He'll realize it when I file a report and write his name in *all caps.*"

---

They share a tired glance.

One moment of mutual understanding between **the marine** and **the princess**.

Then they both **hoist your limp body again**, your boots dragging lightly in the puddle you created.

---

> **Tashigi:** "Come on, teacher. Let's get you somewhere dry before the ants find you."  
> **Vivi:** "And maybe somewhere with pillows that *aren't me.*"

---

They walk on.

Together.

---

**OOC:**
- Alabarna is saved.
- Crocodile is defeated.
- The story continues-but your part in this battle is over.

Would you like next scene to be:

1. {The Straw Hats saying farewell.}  
2. {Waking up, again, elsewhere-with bandages and recognition.}  
3. {A time skip epilogue, back home.}

>> USER: Option X - Smoker notices his subordinate dragging some unknown man around with the princess of Alabasta (he doesn't know the source of the kiwi elemental, or how it was summoned)

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Unseen Watcher Returns]**  
**Scene: "Cigars and Suspicion"**  
**POV: Smoker**  
**Tone: Low-Burning Tension | Mood: Shrewd Observation with a Hint of Concern**

---

The battlefield has quieted.  
Smoke-both literal and metaphorical-rises into the desert air.  
The scent of **pulverized sand, ozone, and inexplicably kiwi** lingers over the shattered capital.

---

From a rooftop on the far side of the plaza, a **figure materializes out of mist and fury**,  
his **Marine coat draped over his shoulders**,  
his **cigar half-lit**, jaw clenched, boots dragging slightly from **fresh, half-healed wounds**.

He's been through hell.

A **locked cage**, miles of **burned corridors**, half a city of chaos.

And now?

He sees her.

---

**Tashigi.**  
Covered in pulp.  
Dragging some limp civilian with Vivi Nefertari like it's an everyday field trip.  
Her sword is broken. Her posture wrecked.  
And her expression?

Not defeated.

Just... **exhausted.** But proud.

---

Smoker narrows his eyes.

> "The hell did I miss."

---

He steps forward on the rooftop, steam swirling around him.

He sees the **wreckage of Crocodile** smashed into the palace.

The **Straw Hat crew** regrouping, several of them laughing as they try to peel sticky juice off their clothes.

He sees **no sand**.

Not a single trace.

---

But most importantly-

He sees the **mystery man.**

The one being lugged around like a wet carpet.

Civilian?  
Agent?  
Marine?

He's wearing a **schoolteacher's coat**.  
His face is **bruised**.  
His body is **half-pulped**.  
But there's **something about him.**

---

> "Who the hell is that guy?"

---

He watches the trio vanish down a side street.  
Tashigi hasn't seen him yet.

But she's **smiling.**

The princess is smiling too.

And that man-**that goddamn kiwi-scented civilian-**  
he just **shifted slightly in his sleep** and murmured something about **"homework due dates."**

---

Smoker sighs, biting down on his cigar.

> "...I really hope that idiot's not a Devil Fruit user."

He exhales.

> "Because I think he just made himself the *most unpredictable variable in Alabasta.*"

---

He vanishes in smoke.

Watching. Waiting.

Knowing this file isn't closed.

---

**OOC:**
- Smoker has returned and now has **eyes on your character**.
- He does not yet know the full extent of your involvement.
- You may become **a person of interest** in his report to the Marines.

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {You waking up with Smoker nearby, quietly watching.}  
2. {Straw Hats' farewell and Vivi's choice.}  
3. {A secret debrief between Tashigi and Smoker.}

>> USER: Option X - Smoker goes to Tashigic. Did she pick him up at a bar in the middle of battle?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Backstreets - Citrus Debrief]**  
**Scene: "Bar Pickup or Battlefield Hero?"**  
**POV: Smoker**  
**Tone: Dry | Mood: Deadpan Tension Meets Emotional Fallout**

---

A coil of **smoke snakes into the alley**, cutting through the lingering mist of evaporating kiwi like a sharpened sigh.

**Tashigi stiffens.**

**Vivi freezes.**

And the third member of their sticky trio-you-gives a tiny snore and nuzzles deeper into Vivi's side, now firmly wrapped in a blanket of bandages and dried pulp.

---

Smoker appears in full a moment later, stepping from vapor like a judge entering a ruined courtroom.

He doesn't say anything at first.

Just **stares**.

At the broken streets.

At the still-smoking crater where a Warlord fell.

At the **utterly drenched, beat-to-hell, juice-scented mess** of a man his subordinate is dragging through the city like she lost a drinking bet.

He takes one long, smoldering puff from his cigar.

---

> "Tashigi."

His tone is flat as the desert floor.

> "Did you pick this guy up at a **bar** in the middle of a battlefield, or...?"

---

**Tashigi doesn't even flinch.**

She gives him a glare that could slice a cannonball.

> "No, sir."

She adjusts her grip on your shoulder, then nods toward the plaza behind them.

> "I picked him up after he *summoned a juice elemental,* tanked two assassination attempts, dragged himself into the center of Cro</pre>
