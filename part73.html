<pre>al compass, and **absolutely no better ideas.**

> "Blue, if you've got another tank, another battalion, or a Navy Admiral in your pocket..."

You shrug-your voice bone-dry:

> "...Now's the time."

Silence.

> "Didn't think so."

**Vivi stares down at the vial.**  
She doesn't want to hand it over. Every line of her posture screams *don't make me.*

But then she looks into your eyes.

And she sees it.

Not resolve.

Not fearlessness.

But that **frustrating, responsible adult instinct**.

The one that made you dive between her and assassins.  
The one that refused to run.  
The one that **teaches** by example-even if it kills you.

---

She places the vial in your palm.

Slow.

Like it might shatter the moment she lets go.

> "Eatone-sensei..."

> "Don't die."

---

You look at the glass in your hand.

It's tiny. Barely a shot.

Tastes probably like mouthwash mixed with lightning.

---

You smirk, just a little.

> "Hey..."

> "First time I've gotten a drink during school hours."

**OOC: You now possess the Hero Water.**  
Drinking it will give you:  
- Temporary **near-max stamina and physical enhancement**  
- **Heightened Fruit control** (within reason)  
- Ability to **move, fight, and react at full strength for five minutes**  
- **Permanent death** if no medical attention is given after the window closes

You are moments away from making the choice.

Would you like to:

1. {Drink it now. Join the battle above.}  
2. {Wait. Give it to someone else if needed.}  
3. {Offer a final line or joke before you go full juicebox berserker.}

>> USER: ​Option 3 - I stare at Vivi, raising an eyebrow. Don't die? I'm pretty sure this guarantees you die.

---

You stare at the little vial in your palm-barely heavier than a breath, but dense with meaning.

The silver-blue liquid **glints in the desert sun**, swirling like a storm in a bottle.

You look up at **Vivi**, raising an eyebrow like you're checking a homework excuse.

---

> "Don't die?" you echo.

You scoff, weakly.

> "I'm *pretty sure* this guarantees you die."

---

Her breath catches.

You see the corners of her mouth twitch-*not in amusement*, but in raw, painful disbelief. The kind of expression only someone about to lose something precious wears.

> "It's not funny."

---

You hold up the vial, squinting at it like you're grading it.

> "Well, it's a little funny."

> "Dying because I drank bad juice? Honestly on-brand for me."

---

She steps forward like she might yank it back, like she can undo this moment by sheer force of will-

But she stops.

Because she knows.

You *are* going to drink it.

Because you're not just a teacher.

You're **her teacher.**

And no one hurts your students on your watch.

---

**Tashigi watches silently**, face tight, fists clenched.  
**The Straw Hats are silent.**  
No jokes from Usopp.  
No quips from Sanji.  
Even Zoro's jaw is set.

---

Because they know.

This isn't some clever stunt.

This is the part of the lesson that only the **grown-up in the room** can teach.

---

The bell is about to ring.

And you're **not going to let class end early.**

---

**OOC:**

This is your final moment of choice before drinking the Hero Water.

Would you like to:

1. {Chug it now-launch into the sky and give Crocodile hell.}  
2. {Say one last line to the kids-Vivi, Tashigi, the Straw Hats.}  
3. {Wait-buy just a few more seconds before the final bell.}

>> USER: ​Option 2 - observe the others. Slow get to my knees

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Teacher Stands]**  
**Scene: "Eyes on Me"**  
**Tone: Weighted | Mood: The Silence Before Sacrifice**

---

The vial rests in your hand, **cold as dread**.  
The silence around you isn't just tension-it's respect.  
Unspoken, grim, heavy respect.

You've seen it before in the classroom, after a hard truth sinks in.  
This isn't a lecture.  
This is a **lesson no one wants to witness.**

---

You shift.

Your knees scream, but you push through the pain.  
Your **handplants** into the cobblestone.  
One foot slips.  
Then braces.

**You rise.**

Not all the way-but **to your knees**, your spine curving like a man resisting gravity itself.

A man deciding-*no, not yet*.

---

The others watch.

**Vivi's eyes shimmer**, lips parted, the weight of a kingdom behind them.  
She doesn't speak. She can't.  
This is your stage now.

**Tashigi's gaze narrows**, fists clenched so tight her bandages stain red.  
She's fought beside you, bled beside you.

**Chopper stares** with a healer's horror.

**Nami's arms are crossed**, but her face betrays the lump in her throat.

**Sanji lights a cigarette.** Doesn't smoke it.  
Just lights it. For the silence.

**Zoro bows his head.** Quiet. No mocking words.

**Usopp doesn't move.** Doesn't blink.

---

Even **Luffy**, far above, turns his battered face toward the plaza-  
As if something inside him **feels it**.

Feels you.

---

The man who slid into battle on juice, cracked jokes between near-death, and **called himself a teacher** with no army, no crew, no Devil Fruit to break the sky-

Just **kiwi juice and spite.**

---

You look at each of them.

Each of your kids.

Your students.

And you **see it.**

That they're waiting for you to say something.

One last line.

One last *thing they'll remember.*

---

**OOC:**  
Your knees are shaking. The vial is still in your hand.  
You have this **one moment** before fate pushes you forward.

Would you like to:

1. {Deliver a final line-directed to them all.}  
2. {Address someone specific (Vivi, Tashigi, the Straw Hats).}  
3. {Say nothing. Let the act speak for itself.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - well, I sure hope that it doesn't taste too bad. I conjure a tiny kiwi elemental at my feet, just making sure that my power still works before I down the drink. Would be a waste of it only powered me up when I could only throw punches.

I keep the tiny elemental up. I stare at the drink, building resolve. 

OOC: Any objections? (There may be none)

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - One Sip From Immortality, or Death]**  
**Scene: "The Last Pretest Check"**  
**Tone: Weighted Anticipation | Mood: Hearts Held at the Edge**

---

You hold the vial steady, fingers curled tight.  
Its glow flickers against your skin-**hero water**, the kind of name a child would trust, and a soldier would die for.

But before you commit, you flick your wrist.

A small **ripple of green** slithers around your heel-  
**a tiny kiwi elemental**, barely the size of a cat, burbling out of the cobblestones with a wobbling grunt.

It blinks at you.

Wobbles.

Then **flexes a stubby arm**.

---

You smirk. It works.  
Your power's still there.  
Not much-but enough to show that **the engine isn't dead**.

You give the little blob a nod.

> "Good. I'd hate to go out just throwing punches."

---

You stare down at the vial again, the glow now **reflected in the eyes of everyone around you**.

No one's speaking.

Not a single one.

---

**Chopper's hooves twitch**, but he bites his tongue.  
**Tashigi looks ready to stop you**, but her knees don't move.  
**Vivi's holding her breath** like it's the only thing keeping her from screaming.

Even **Luffy**, overhead, watches the glow from the edge of the rooftop, battered and barely standing.

---

They understand now.

This isn't a dramatic stand.

It's a **teacher making damn sure his class gets home safe.**

---

**OOC: There are no objections.**

None dare speak.

None dare stop you.

Because they all know-

**You've already chosen.**

---

Would you like to:

1. {Drink the Hero Water now. No more words.}  
2. {Say one last line-to them, to yourself, to fate.}  
3. {Hand the vial to someone else, if you've changed your mind.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - Hmm. All or nothing. I raise the vial to my lips...

Only for my arms to cramp at the last second, and the vial fa</pre>
