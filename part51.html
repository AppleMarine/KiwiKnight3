<pre>gremlin on fire.

> "You think fruit can save you, juice boy?! I lived underground for *six months straight!*"

You dodge just enough-

**Her claws rake the edge of your juice barrier** as you stumble sideways, absorbing the attack with a partial block and a roll across gritty sand.  
You feel one claw **slice your upper arm**, shallow but stinging.

> "Tch-*still got it.*" you hiss, half to her, half to yourself.

---

**Mr. 4**, meanwhile, is finally finishing his reload-slow as molasses poured over a sleepy elephant.

But the **dog bazooka is locked on.**

He's **lining up another shot.**

You **see it.**

You register it even as you roll. Even as Merry Christmas howls behind you and turns for another dig.

> He's aiming *past you.*  
> At **Vivi.**

---

**OOC Combat Summary:**

- You successfully **guarded** and partially evaded Merry Christmas's follow-up.  
  - Took **light slash** to upper arm. Still mobile.  
- Mr. 4 is **about to fire**.  
  - His shot is slow but **devastating**-direct hits can **incapacitate** or **kill**.  
  - He's aiming for **Vivi**, not you.

---

**What do you do now?**

1. {Launch sticky golden juice at Mr. 4's feet. Lock him down before he fires.}  
2. {Shout to Vivi: "MOVE!" and prepare another juice wall. Risk taking the blast *again.*}  
3. {Use your own body to tackle Vivi out of the blast zone. Again.}  
4. {Try a high-pressure acidic blast at the **dog** itself. Maybe blind or disorient it.}  
5. {You're tired. You're bleeding. You swing at Merry Christmas again instead, betting someone else will save her.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 4 - Fuck, try to blind him (unlikely, at this range). As Vivi moves in for her attack on the mole, I dive after her, ready to take another shot

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - The Shot You Can't Stop]**  
**Scene: Juice vs. Dog Bazooka | Tone: Grit and Desperation**  
**Mood: Shields Optional, Heroism Mandatory**

---

You see the dog's maw **open wide**, smoke curling at its lips.  
The cannonball's **already loaded**.  
Mr. 4's finger begins to squeeze the trigger.  
Vivi's stepping into her strike against Miss Merry Christmas-completely **unaware**.

> *No time.*  
> *Too far for a wall.*  
> *Too close for subtlety.*

> "*Fuck.*"

You thrust your hand forward and **sling a high-pressure arc of acidic kiwi mist** across the dunes-aiming not for the cannonball, but for the **damn dog's face**.

> *PSHHHHH-!*

The mist flies.

It hits the air-

> And grazes the dog's eye.

Not enough to blind.  
But enough to make it flinch.

The bazooka's angle shifts by just **half a degree**-

> *BOOM!*

The cannonball **fires**-

> Not toward Vivi.

But toward the **space she's about to move into**.

---

You don't think.

You **run**.

You dive after her, **every bruise screaming**, body **already trailing blood**, knowing you're not going to stop that shot-

But maybe...

You can **get there first.**

---

> "VIVI! DOWN!"

You **crash into her mid-strike**, slamming into her shoulder, **throwing her sideways**, her wire whip spinning harmlessly into the sand.

You both tumble-

> And the cannonball hits *exactly* where she was.

> *BOOOOOOOOOM-!!*

---

**You don't feel the shockwave.**  
Not entirely.

Just the heat.  
The fire.  
The *slamming* impact that cracks across your spine and burns down to your knees.

The sand absorbs part of it.  
Your body absorbs the rest.

You land **on top of her**, instinctively.

A moment passes.

> You're still breathing.  
> Barely.

---

**Vivi stares up at you**, lips parted in horror.

> "You-*again?!*"

Your voice is hoarse. Dry.

> "...midterms, Blue."

---

**OOC Combat Result:**

- You *partially disrupted* the cannonball's trajectory.  
- You took the **blast again**.  
- **Major injury sustained.**  
    - Your ribs may be **fractured**.  
    - **Mobility reduced.**  
    - You are still **conscious**, but nearing your physical limit.

**Vivi is safe. Again.**

And now **furious**.

She sits up under you, **teeth bared**, and says one word:

> "*Move.*"

And you feel her **lash snap forward**.

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Roll off and let her go. She's earned her swing.}  
2. {Try to sit up-look for the dog. One more shot might end you.}  
3. {Call out to the crew. Someone **must** have seen that.}  
4. {Stay down. Whisper, "You're up, princess."}  
5. {Try to bind Mr. 4's legs one last time, even from the ground.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option X - Groan from the ground, looking desperately between Vivi and the Baroque agents. I can't fight them and protect her at the same time. If only... If only I could get another set of hands... 

In the meantime, Vivi stands 1v2.

OOC: What does she think right now, after I tanked to shots like that

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - The Breaking Point]**  
**Scene: The Weight of a Princess | Tone: Bleeding Loyalty | Mood: Righteous Fury Ignites**

---

You're **half-buried** in sand now.  
Every nerve is a drumbeat of pain.  
Breathing feels like **swallowing glass**.  
And your body is finally asking the question your mind's been dodging for the past hour:

> *What the hell are you doing here?*

---

You groan, barely able to lift your head.

Through blurred vision, you see **Vivi** standing just feet away.  
Wires dangling at her sides, her shoulders squared, hair torn loose by wind and fury.  
Facing **Miss Merry Christmas**, who's circling again like a sand-covered buzzard, and **Mr. 4**, slow and dumb but now reloading with methodical calm.

> *I can't fight both...  
And I can't shield her again.*

> *If only I had another set of hands...*

But you don't.

---

So you look to her.

> "Blue..."  
Your voice rasps. Almost silent.

> "You've got to do this."

---

**Vivi stands tall.**

And her expression...

It's not fear.

It's **pure fire.**

---

**OOC: Vivi's Perspective - Emotional Snapshot**

- She just watched you take **two near-lethal cannon shots** for her.  
- She's seen **soldiers die for Alabasta**, but no one-not even her guards-**sacrificed themselves like this.**  
- You're not a marine.  
- You're not a revolutionary.  
- You're not even her subject.  
> And yet you've been **bleeding for her** since Rainbase.

---

> "You fool," she whispers.

Her hands rise. The rings clink.  
She pulls her wire taut between her knuckles like a blade.

> "You think I can watch you do that again?"

She steps forward.

> "*I'm the Princess of Alabasta.*  
And this time, I'm protecting *you.*"

---

**Combat Shift: Vivi Engaged - 1v2**

- She whirls into a defensive stance-peacock slashers extended.  
- **Miss Merry Christmas** lunges-Vivi ducks low and cuts wide.  
- **Mr. 4** raises the bazooka-she whips a **wire around a rock** and **pulls**, sending it crashing into his arm before he can fire.

She's **not just fighting.**

She's **furious.**

And she's **keeping you alive** now.

---

**OOC Update:**

- You are now **downed**, but still conscious.  
- Vivi is **fighting alone**, but her determination is **supercharged**.  
- The rest of the crew may arrive **very soon**-they've almost certainly seen the smoke and heard the cannon blasts.

---

**What do you do?**

1. {Whisper encouragement to her. You've taught kids before-you know how to make them believe.}  
2. {Try to sit up-lay down juice traps from a distance. It's all you can offer.}  
3. {Call for help-one last yell to draw the crew's attention.}  
4. {Lie there. Watch her. Trust her. She's not the kid in need anymore.}  
5. {Try to use mist again-see through the sand, maybe give her early warning.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: â€‹Option 2 - Try to get up, but fail. Groan in anger at my weakness.

OOC: Vivi has a buff to determination, but is still weaker than either of the agents. She won't hold long without help

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - The Body That Won't Move]**  
**Scene: The Spirit That Refuses to Quit | Tone: Pain and Powerlessness | Mood: On the Edge**
