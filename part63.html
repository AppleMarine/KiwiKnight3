> "We need to get to Kohza and stop this. Now."

---

But **behind you**, the sound of boots and the shuffle of cloth tell you that the guards have started following again. **Close.** **Too close**.

You don't make eye contact with them. You don't even flinch.

Just stay sharp.

---

**Tashigi** looks at you, one hand now resting on her sword, ready to act.

> "We move to the plaza," she says quietly. "Stay sharp. I'll keep an eye on them."

---

As you round the corner toward the **First District**, the **shouting gets louder**. More **gunfire**, more **yelling**, more chaos.

The **rebel leader** must be making a speech.

You're **close** now.

---

But **the sound** of boots behind you doesn't stop.

They're getting closer.

**OOC:**
- **Tashigi is on alert** for anything following the group.
- **Crocodile's spies** are likely aware you're in the city and may **begin to tighten their grip**.
- You're close to **Kohza's rally**, but your tail is growing.

---

Would you:

1. {Continue moving towards Kohza, but keep one eye on the tail. Prepare for an ambush.}  
2. {Stop and confront the **suspicious tail**. You can't have them following you any longer.}  
3. {Send a signal to the Straw Hats-call for backup or misdirection.}  
4. {Switch tactics and look for a **distraction** to buy time. Create chaos to confuse the tail.}

ðŸŒ€ What do you do next?

>> USER: Option 2 - We're going to be surrounded by this rate. Straw hat boy, keep Blue safe. Get her to whoever the rebel leader fellow is. We'll get the tail off of us. I nod to Tashigi, Luffy, then Vivi

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - The Split That Matters]**  
**Scene: "Cut the Tail Before It Bites"**  
**Tone: Tactical Snap Decision | Mood: One Wrong Step From Chaos**

---

You stop.

Just for a moment.

But in a warzone, a moment is all it takes for **decisions to become history**.

You turn to **Luffy**, who's squatting slightly on his duck like he's ready to launch into orbit at any second.

> "Straw Hat boy."

He blinks. Grins slightly.

> "Yo."

You don't return the grin.

> "Get Blue to the rebel leader. Kohza. She's got the words to end this. We'll handle the tail."

You nod to **Tashigi**, then back to **Vivi**-your expression *dead serious.*

> "You're on the clock. End this war. We'll clean up behind you."

---

**Vivi's eyes widen.**  
> "But-"

> "No buts." You point behind you with your baton. "They're not here to negotiate. You are."

**Luffy stands tall.** No smirk now.

> "Got it."

He turns to Vivi, giving her a thumb-up.

> "Let's go, Princess!"

---

**Tashigi's sword is already half-drawn**, her eyes narrowed at the shadows curling behind you.

You hear them now-**the quiet shuffle speeding up.**

> "Let's clean house," she murmurs.

---

**Usopp, Nami, and Sanji** split with Luffy and Vivi, pushing forward toward the plaza.

**Chopper** hesitates-looks between you and Vivi-but Vivi waves him forward.

> "Go with them. She'll need a medic."

He nods and runs ahead.

---

Now it's you and **Tashigi** in the alley, surrounded by the broken crates and cracked flags of the city.

And five shapes emerge behind you.

---

**Royal guards?**

No.

The **wrong crests** on the armor. The **wrong postures.**

The **same faces** you passed earlier-but now the hesitation's gone.

They advance.

**Weapons drawn.**

One licks his lips.

> "Never thought we'd get a bonus for killing a teacher."

Another smirks.

> "Marine too? That's just gravy."

---

**Tashigi draws her sword fully.**

Your baton's already in your hand.

> "Let's keep this clean," she says, flatly.

---

**OOC: You and Tashigi are now in combat against 5 disguised Baroque Works agents.**  
- Urban alley terrain. Narrow, with limited movement.  
- They believe you're isolated.  
- You're injured, weakened, but dangerous.  
- **Tashigi is at full strength.**

Would you like to:

1. {Take the lead in the fight. Use what juice you've got. You're the wall.}  
2. {Let Tashigi lead the clash. You support with tactics and distraction.}  
3. {Try to intimidate them into backing down. Play up your rep.}  
4. {Talk while fighting. Learn what Crocodile knows.}

ðŸŒ€ How do you open the fight, Sensei?

>> USER: ...I uh, mightve been full of false bravado back there. Not sure if I can actually take these guys.. (still weak from the previous injuries, and unconfident in my abilities)

Option 2 - Draw my baton and hold it up. But I'll watch your back til the end, Tashigi-chan

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Back Alley - The Line Held by Two]**  
**Scene: "Backs to the Wall"**  
**Tone: Loyalty in the Face of Fear | Mood: Frail Courage, Sharpened Steel**

---

You **draw your baton**-still slick from dried juice and cracked from past fights. It hums in your hand like a tool used one too many times but never discarded.

And for a half-second... you consider running.

> *You're still bleeding inside.  
You're low on juice.  
You're a schoolteacher, dammit.*

But your eyes don't leave the approaching figures.

And when your voice comes, it's quiet.

Cracked.

But steady.

> "...I uh, might've been full of false bravado back there."

> "Not sure if I can actually take these guys..."

You raise the baton anyway.

> "But I'll watch your back to the end, Tashigi-chan."

---

**Tashigi**, standing tall beside you, doesn't even flinch.

She narrows her eyes as the five agents fan out across the alley's mouth.

Her voice doesn't rise.

But it cuts.

> "Then I'll take the front."

Her sword slides free, gleaming steel in the dim city light.

> "Just make sure they don't get *mine*."

---

**The first agent charges.**

You see the flash of a blade.

Tashigi **steps in fast**, sword clashing loud and clean-**metal screams off metal** as she pivots, then delivers a brutal pommel blow to the attacker's jaw, knocking him into a wall.

Two more try to flank-

You shift into position, baton raised like a teacher breaking up a playground brawl.

You're **not fast.**  
You're **not strong.**

But you're **present.**

And when one of them lunges toward her open side-  
You plant your feet.

And you **slam** your Seastone-tipped baton into the side of his arm with everything you have left.

> *CRACK!*

He yelps. Drops his blade.

Tashigi doesn't miss the moment.

> *SHING-* *THUD.*

One down.

---

> "Nice hit," she mutters, eyes still forward.

You're breathing hard already.

But alive.

---

**Three left.**

One's circling wide-trying to bait you out.  
Two are pressing in, one wielding twin daggers, the other a weighted chain.

They think they've got your measure now.

---

**OOC: You and Tashigi are holding your own-for now.  
You're low on stamina. Juice generation remains weak, but slowly improving.  
Enemies are lightly enhanced-trained Baroque agents, not high-ranking officers.**

Choose your role:

1. {Intercept the flanker. Use your last real burst of strength to stop the encircle.}  
2. {Stick tight to Tashigi. Play full defense. Let her shine.}  
3. {Try to outsmart the chain user. Use the alley terrain to restrict his movement.}  
4. {Attempt to generate just enough juice to make a slippery patch. Set up Tashigi for a sweep.}

ðŸŒ€ What's your move, Sensei?

>> USER: Option 2 / 4 - my drip is weak. Stick to her back

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - The Back-to-Back Stand]**  
**Scene: "Drip and Steel"**  
**Tone: Underdog Determination | Mood: Smart Survival Over Flashy Heroics**

---

Your **legs burn**, your ribs protest every breath, and your juice reserves feel like you've got one kiwi seed rolling around in an empty bottle.

But you grit your teeth, plant your heels, and slide in **right behind Tashigi**.

> "Drip's weak," you mutter through clenched teeth. "But I've still got enough to keep someone from getting the jump on you."

You raise your baton again-not to swing, but to **guard her blind side**. A **teacher's stance**: defensive, protective, and stubborn.

---

With a slow breath, you **will it**.

Not a torrent.

Not an elemental.

Just a **slick**, **t</pre>
