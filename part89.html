<pre> to decide.

Would you like to:

1. {Stay in this moment - ask questions, reflect with them.}  
2. {Breakfast scene - walk (or limp) to the dining room.}  
3. {Straw Hat farewell - the city begins to gather.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - Blink. Outlaw?

Whoa hold on a second. I'm an outlaw? I'm a legal bounty hunter! I can't have a felony on my record, I'd get fired!

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing - Bounty Panic Syndrome]**  
**Scene: "Administrative Dread"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Spiraling | Mood: Light Panic, Deadpan Support**

Your eyes pop open fully now, the haze of sleep and citrus bliss **immediately evaporating** in the face of **true, adult horror**:

> "Whoa-*hold on a second.*"

You shift, your blanket half-falling off your chest as you half-sit, half-freak.

> "*I'm an outlaw?!*"

You point at yourself like you're trying to summon an internal HR department.

> "I'm a **legal** bounty hunter! I filled out the forms! I got the rubber-stamped ID! I even laminated it!"

A beat.

> "If I have a **felony** on my record, I'll get fired!"

> "You don't understand, I'll lose my teaching license, I won't even be able to chaperone field trips-*the paperwork alone would kill me!*"

---

**Tashigi** doesn't flinch.

She doesn't blink.

She just reaches into the pouch at her hip, pulls out a scroll.

Unrolls it halfway.

**Marine seal.**

> "Provisional Exemption, Article 17-F: Civilian combatant operating in national defense under Article 2-K."

> "Witnessed by a Marine officer of my rank or higher."

---

She stares at you with a flat expression.

Then rolls it back up with a *thwap.*

> "You're welcome."

---

You blink.

Your mouth opens.

Closes.

---

> "...You wrote me a note?"

---

> "*A legal note,*" Tashigi corrects, smug.

> "One that says ‘This teacher is allowed to beat up war criminals if the situation warrants it.'"

---

**Vivi**, meanwhile, is **laughing into her hands** again, face flushed from the effort of not making it worse.

> "You're going to go down in Alabastan history as the only man who stormed a warlord's operation and then **panicked about his resume.**"

---

You slump back down into the pillows.

> "I just wanted to earn some vacation time and maybe try the local kebab shops."

---

**Tashigi:**  
> "You *got* the kebabs. You also turned into a fruit elemental and body-checked an ancient Warlord into the wall of a palace."

---

**Vivi:**  
> "And still remembered hall pass policies while unconscious. It's incredible."

---

You stare at the ceiling.

Blankly.

> "I'm going to have to write *so many lesson plans* to process this..."

---

**OOC:**
- Tashigi has legally covered your ass with a Marine exemption.
- You do **not** have a criminal record.
- Your "temporary outlaw" status was more confusion than prosecution-**no felony, no bounty**, just a very confused Marine HQ en route.
- You are still **technically on vacation.**

Would you like to:

1. {Wrap up this conversation with one final note or ask a question.}  
2. {Begin the day - breakfast, walking again, final choices.}  
3. {Shift to the Straw Hat farewell. Time is short.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - Ugh. I think I've already went over my remaining vacation days. The principals going to cook my arse over this.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing - Civilian Problems After War Crimes]**  
**Scene: "Time Off Well Abused"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Resigned | Mood: Melodramatic and Pulp-Scented**

---

You stare blankly at the ceiling, letting the warmth of the fancy sheets cradle your overcooked, trauma-marinated body while your brain goes to *the one place no battlefield ever prepared you for*-

> **Your workplace.**

---

> "Ugh..."

You drag a hand down your face.

> "I think I've already gone over my remaining vacation days."

Another pause.

You squeeze your eyes shut.

> "The principal's gonna *cook my ass* over this..."

---

**Tashigi** stares at you. Absolutely baffled.

> "You're worried about your *boss*?"

---

**Vivi** leans in, visibly trying not to giggle again.

> "You fought a Warlord."

> "You literally soaked a capital city in juice."

> "You saved a *kingdom.*"

---

You sigh heavily into the pillow.

> "And the first thing he's gonna ask is why I didn't write in to have someone cover third period **home ec.**"

---

**Tashigi**, dry as the desert outside:

> "You created a kaiju made of kiwi juice. I think he can forgive some unpaid leave."

---

You roll your head toward her, grumbling:

> "He didn't forgive Jenkins for accidentally melting the chemistry lab beakers."

---

**Vivi's** laughing again, one hand over her mouth.

---

> "I am going to have to write the most deranged **vacation form** in recorded history."

You mime it dramatically:

> "*‘Requesting three days personal time to assist a princess, defend a kingdom, awaken fruit-based god, and protect a minor from government-backed terrorism. Will return Tuesday.'*"

---

**Tashigi:**  
> "...Be sure to list ‘weather-related absence' as the reason."

---

**Vivi:**  
> "Should we sign off as witnesses?"

---

You sigh again, deeply and dramatically.

> "At least let me recover enough to walk before the bureaucracy gets me..."

---

And for a while...

There's only laughter in that room.

Genuine, exhausted, *healing* laughter.

The kind you only earn when the nightmare's over and you lived to be annoyed by *paperwork*.

---

**OOC:**
- This was your final grace note in this scene.
- The tone has shifted from crisis to closure.
- You've reaffirmed who you are: **a teacher, a protector, and deeply allergic to HR forms**.

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {Scene skip - Straw Hats' farewell gathering.}  
2. {Breakfast scene - your first steps again.}  
3. {Vivi pulls you aside for a quiet goodbye before the others arrive.}

>> USER: Option X - ​I mean, I'm not royalty or a marine officer like you two, I've still got to make a living. 

I don't say it harshly or accusingly, just a matter of factly.

I start mentally drafting a letter of apology to the headmaster

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing - Perspective, and Paperwork Pending]**  
**Scene: "The Letter You'll Probably Never Send"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Grounded | Mood: Thoughtful, Bittersweet, Deepening Bonds**

---

The room is still.

Sunlight peeks in through the silk curtains, warming the gold trim of the palace furniture, glinting softly off the polished hilt of Tashigi's sword, and catching in the curls of Vivi's hair.

You shift again-not to be dramatic this time, but just to get comfortable in a way that doesn't make your cracked ribs sing.

Your voice, when it comes, is **soft**. Not bitter. Not ashamed.

Just... **true**.

---

> "I mean..."

> "I'm not royalty, or a Marine officer like you two."

> "I've still gotta make a living."

---

No judgment.

No weight thrown.

Just a truth you've carried all along.

---

**Vivi's smile falters-not because she's offended, but because she hears it.** Really hears it.

> "Of course you do," she says gently, her voice more steady than it had any right to be after all she's endured.

> "But... that doesn't make what you did any less extraordinary."

---

**Tashigi** doesn't say anything immediately, but her jaw tenses slightly. She looks at you-not with pity.

But with the kind of understanding that can only come from **wearing a uniform that no one sees until it's convenient**.

---

You look up at the ceiling again, half-buried in the absurd amount of imported goose-down you're lying in.

You start mentally drafting:

> "*Dear Headmaster,*  
> *I regret to inform you that I may have slightly overextended my leave, on account of... unintended geopolitical circumstances involving a known Warlord, an endangered princess, and moderate-to-severe citrus-based destruction.*"

---

Your brow furrows slightly.

> "*I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused in the faculty scheduling roster.*"

You blink.

Then add mentally:

> "*P.S. I promise I didn't bre</pre>
