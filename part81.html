<pre>NT: **[Alubarna Plaza - Dignity Versus Gravity]**  
**Scene: "We Have Napgaged the Enemy"**  
**Tone: Battle-Ready | Mood: Sweet Regret and Sloppy Heroism**

---

You groan.  
It's the groan of a man who has made **some choices**.  
Some of them **heroic**, others... deeply questionable.

You wiggle your fingers, then your toes.  
Your arms still feel like **wet towels** soaked in trauma and citrus.  
Your spine? It's lobbying to declare independence.

But your **will**?

> *Firm.*  
> *Professional.*  
> *Desperately trying to get out of a royal lap.*

---

> "I am... so... so sorry about this..."

You start to push yourself up.

Your elbows tremble.

Your back does a strange **pop-crunch-twang** noise.

You rise exactly **three inches**-

> *fwump*

And land **right back** where you started.

Face first.

Lap deep.

---

**Vivi's face is a national emergency.**

> "Wh-Why?! Are you cursed?! Did your Devil Fruit do this?!"

---

**Tashigi's face is unreadable.**  
Like a woman trying to hold in either a lecture or a scream. Possibly both.

---

> "M'just... legs aren't legging," you mutter.

> "I'll... move soon. I promise."

---

But even as your dignity remains in critical condition, your **mind** is sharp enough to do what matters most:

You lift your right hand.

Point it toward the rooftop.

> "Kiwi-kun... go help the rubber idiot."

---

The **Kiwi Elemental** pulses.

It straightens.

And with a mighty roar like a thousand angry juice boxes being opened at once, it **charges**.

---

**Crocodile turns, too late.**

He raises a wall of sand-  
The Elemental punches through.

Luffy lunges from the flank-  
Crocodile reels, **boxed in.**

---

For the first time, the Warlord of the Sands is being **pressed.**

Not just by power-

But by teamwork.

By chaos.

By juice.

---

**OOC:**
- The Elemental has re-entered battle at full aggression, now coordinated with Luffy.
- Crocodile is officially off-balance and under pressure.
- You remain in Vivi's lap, attempting dignity, but mostly apologizing.
- The tide of the battle has shifted in favor of the Straw Hat alliance.

Would you like to:

1. {Attempt another escape from Lapland. Risky.}
2. {Say something dumb but heartfelt to Vivi or Tashigi.}
3. {Mentally link deeper to the Elemental-guide its strikes.}

>> USER: Option 2 - As to not make everything I've said about being a responsible adult sound hollow, could one of you... Help me off?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - Dignity Requested, Delivery Pending]**  
**Scene: "The Responsible Ask"**  
**Tone: Tender Chaos | Mood: Adulting While Horizontal**

---

You squint at the sky, your vision framed by billowing sand, clashing giants, and the faint mist of citrus vengeance. Your body is *done*. Your nerves are burnt toast with a side of secondhand embarrassment.

But your voice?

**Still composed.**  
Still trying to hold the line of maturity.

---

> "As to not make everything I've said about being a responsible adult sound hollow..."

You gulp. Your cheek's still pressed to something soft and increasingly awkward.

> "Could one of you... *help me off?*"

---

**Vivi stares down at you**, eyes still flushed with adrenaline, embarrassment, and something softer-**something like relief**.

> "Y-you want help?"

She clears her throat. Tries to act composed.

> "After all that...?"

> "The sleeping... The mumbling... The *nuzzling??*"

---

**Tashigi, arms crossed nearby, deadpans:**

> "Oh, now *he* wants to get up."

> "Should we call a *crane*?"

---

You give the smallest, weakest little shrug known to man.

> "I'm just... *very injured.*"

> "And clearly no longer a threat to laps."

---

Vivi exhales slowly, then leans forward and-very gently-slips her arms beneath yours, careful of your bruises.

> "Alright, Sensei. Come on. Let's reclaim what's left of your dignity."

She hauls you upright with **considerable effort**, your knees buckling the moment you try to stand.

**Tashigi grabs the other side**, and between them, you're now **dangling like a very tired backpack between two furious schoolgirls.**

---

**Vivi mutters:**  
> "This is somehow *more awkward* than the lap."

---

**OOC:**
- You're now upright-but barely, with Vivi and Tashigi supporting you on either side.
- Crocodile is being actively pressured by Luffy and the Elemental.
- The tide of battle is swinging rapidly.

Would you like to:

1. {Encourage the girls. You've got this teacher energy, after all.}
2. {Try to guide the Elemental mid-fight. Tactically or emotionally.}
3. {Offer a war-cry. Possibly citrus-themed.}

>> USER: Option 1 - I told you. Involuntary. I'm a good person, I swear.

Observe the state of the battle

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Citrus Crusade Continues]**  
**Scene: "The Good Guy and His God Blob"**  
**Tone: Defensive | Mood: Proud, Petty, and Pulp-Soaked**

---

You hang there between Vivi and Tashigi, arms draped over their shoulders like some half-cooked piÃ±ata of man and regret, your legs making the occasional attempt at autonomy before crumpling under the weight of heroism and excessive blood loss.

You're upright. Technically.

Your dignity?  
Still in recovery.

---

You clear your throat-weakly. Heroically. **Defensively.**

> "I told you. *Involuntary.*"

> "I'm a good person. I swear."

> "I teach *civics,* for God's sake..."

---

**Vivi doesn't look at you.**  
Just keeps you steady with a slight flush in her cheeks and the faintest twitch in her lips. The kind that says she might forgive you. One day.

**Tashigi snorts.**

> "Yeah, well... we'll be adding a *new* chapter to your reputation."

> "Chapter One: How Not to Wake Up in Front of Royalty."

---

You nod solemnly, then immediately wince because it pulls at your bruised shoulder.

> "Fair."

---

You lift your head.

**The battle is raging above-**

The **Kiwi Elemental** is now in full brawl with Crocodile:

- **Every punch** it throws **splatters** pressurized juice into the sandstorm, bogging down Crocodile's movements.
- **Every dodge** Luffy makes redirects Crocodile into a new position-trapped between **rubber and ragefruit**.
- The elemental now seems **smarter**-learning, reacting, pulsing in sync with your gaze.
- And Crocodile? He's **no longer smirking.**

---

He's surrounded. Pinned.

His sand is starting to **clump**.  
His **cloak is stained.**  
His movements-sharper. Angrier. But **predictable.**

The Elemental's timing has gotten better.

Luffy's getting closer.

---

The **endgame is near.**

And they're winning.

Because of **you**.

---

**OOC:**
You are now alert and back in control of your fruit.  
The battle is swinging hard in your favor.  
Crocodile is now pressed-no longer confident. You are moments from victory.

Would you like to:

1. {Issue a final command to the Elemental-one coordinated finishing blow.}  
2. {Let Luffy have it. Support from the sidelines.}  
3. {Say something dumb again. It's tradition now.}

>> USER: Option 3 - Wait! What's the time?!

(Actually need the current time, for a soon to be revealed reason. I will reveal it in a following reply)

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - When the Clock Ticks, So Does Fate]**  
**Scene: "A Sudden, Horrifying Realization"**  
**Tone: Urgency | Mood: Comedic Dread Looming**  

---

As the **sandstorm churns**, and Crocodile fights with the **desperation of a dethroned tyrant**,  
as Luffy launches into the final windup of a punch that might **shatter Alabasta's fate**,  
and as your **juice god** rears back with a **gleaming green uppercut**-

You suddenly gasp.

Eyes wide.

Soul cold.

> "WAIT-!"

Both Vivi and Tashigi jump.

> "*What?!*" they cry in unison, half-expecting another attack.

---

You wrench your neck toward them.

Panic in your eyes.

> "**What time is it?!**"

---

The plaza freezes for a half-second-not from Crocodile, not from destiny-

But from **you**.

---

**Vivi stammers:**  
> "I-I don't know-past noon?? Why?!"

**Tashigi:**  
> "Eatone. What the hell does it matte</pre>
