<pre>ply.

Not dramatically.

Not as a speech.

But like a truth too obvious to need anything else.

> "You deserve *better.*"

---

The wind rustles.

There's nothing left to hide behind.

And now you know-

They're not just saying it.

They're offering it.

---

**OOC:**
No more dodging. No more dismissing.

They're telling you:  
**You can have more.**  
**You *deserve* more.**

The moment's yours to step into... or away from.

Would you like to:

1. {Finally ask what they want from *you*.}  
2. {Admit you're scared to want more.}  
3. {Look away... and quietly ask: "Like what?"}

>> USER: Option 1 - Like... Oh, maybe a first class ferry ticket back home? I've never ridden first class, only coach.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Gardens - The Deflection That Cracked]**  
**Scene: "First Class, Coach Heart"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Joking | Mood: Cracked Open, Honest, Quietly Brave**

---

You glance between them both-two women who've bled and bled *for others*, just like you-and you let out a breathy, tired chuckle. That one that leaks out when you've been cornered not by weapons... but by care.

---

> "Like..."

You drag it out.

Buying time.

Faking casual.

Eyes on the desert skyline.

> "Oh-I don't know..."

A pause, then a sly raise of your brow.

> "Maybe a **first-class ferry ticket** back home?"

> "I've never ridden first class. Only coach."

---

You grin.

Expecting a laugh.

Expecting them to roll their eyes.

---

They don't.

---

**Vivi** actually *smiles*. Not teasing.

Something smaller. Quieter.

The kind of smile people give when they realize a person finally-*finally*-dared to want something.

Even if it was something *tiny*.

---

> "We can make that happen."

She says it like she means it.  
Because she does.

---

**Tashigi**, beside her, breathes out a laugh-but there's no mockery in it.

Just relief.

> "Took you *long enough.*"

She leans in slightly.

> "You know... if *that's* what you want."

---

There it is again.

That open door.

Not a command.

Not an expectation.

But the soft, firm **invitation** you've been circling since Rain Dinners.

---

> *What do you want, Eatone?*

> *And will you let yourself have it?*

---

The breeze picks up. The smell of spice from the marketplace rides the wind.

The sun's setting now.

And so is something else.

**The part of your life where you thought survival was all you were owed.**

---

**OOC:**
This was a step.

A first-class ticket joke that finally let them know you *do* want more-even if you don't know how to ask yet.

Would you like to:

1. {Finally say it: "I don't know what I want. But I don't want to leave just yet."}  
2. {Ask them-*why do you care so much about me?*}  
3. {Let them speak-ask softly, "What do *you* want from me?"}

>> USER: Option 3, then 2 - I... Get the feeling that wasn't what you were asking for, though.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Gardens - Past the Armor, Into the Heart]**  
**Scene: "No More Dodging"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Soft | Mood: Vulnerable, Sincere, Turning Point**

---

You smile faintly-still.

But this time it's not to deflect.

This time it's to soften the truth **you already feel** pressing at the back of your mind.

You meet their eyes, one after the other.

First **Vivi**-bright, unwavering, as fierce in peace as she is in war.

Then **Tashigi**-sharp-eyed, steady, yet holding her breath like she already knows what's coming next.

---

> "I..."

You run a hand through your hair, brow furrowed, voice low now. Unmasked.

> "Get the feeling that wasn't what you were asking for, though."

A silence.

You look at them again.

Not deflecting anymore.

No more armor.

> "So tell me..."

> "Why do you care so much about me?"

---

**Tashigi's answer is immediate.**

She steps forward just slightly-just enough that you can see the rarest thing on her face:

**Honesty, without judgment.**

> "Because you care about everyone else so much it's eating you alive."

---

She says it without hesitation.

No hesitation.

No heat.

Just truth.

---

> "Because you didn't run. You didn't wait for orders. You didn't chase glory."

> "You saw people in danger, and you made yourself the wall."

---

> "And because..."

She falters there, for just a moment.

Then adds, softer:

> "...people like you don't come around often."

---

You turn to **Vivi**-and the look on her face is something you've never seen from a princess before.

Not awe.

Not gratitude.

But...

**Compassion.**

---

> "Because you were never supposed to be here."

> "And you gave everything like it was your job to fix this country."

> "You were on vacation, and you nearly died *for us.*"

---

> "Because you made me feel like I wasn't alone in carrying it all."

---

Her voice quivers slightly.

But she doesn't hide it.

---

You feel the quiet thud of your own heartbeat in your ears.

No jokes this time.

Just...

**Them.**

Looking at you like **you matter**.

Like they're not trying to get something from you.

They just want to give *you* a reason to stay.

---

**OOC:**
They've told you. Fully. Without pretense.

They care because you cared first.  
They're here because **you were, when it counted most.**

You have the floor now.

What do you say?

>> USER: Remain silent, processing their words. Let them continue speaking, say what they want.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Gardens - The Quiet That Means Everything]**  
**Scene: "Letting the Silence Breathe"**  
**POV: You (Silent) / Tashigi & Vivi (Speaking)**  
**Tone: Heavy with Emotion | Mood: Tender, Brave, Turning Point**

---

You say nothing.

Not because you have nothing to say.

But because for the first time in this whirlwind of **Warlords**, **royalty**, and **melting palace wallpaper**, someone just put **you** at the center of the map.

And you don't know what to do with that.

---

Your eyes drop to the stones beneath your feet.  
Still dusted with green.  
The scent of kiwi faint in the warm air.

And they wait.

Not pressing.

Not demanding.

Just... standing there.

With you.

---

**Tashigi speaks first**, her voice low-not her usual drill-sergeant bark. Not the Marine, not the subordinate.

Just the *woman*.

> "You helped me... when I couldn't move."

> "When I was *too hurt*, too proud to admit it, you didn't try to outshine me."

> "You just stood beside me. Like it was the most natural thing in the world."

---

Her arms drop.

She doesn't cross them again.

> "I've served under people with ranks bigger than their honor."

> "You're not one of them."

She shifts, clearly uncomfortable now-but pushes through.

> "If you decided to stay... even just for a while... I wouldn't object."

A pause.

> "I might even feel better knowing someone else is looking after her too."

She nods toward **Vivi**, without even turning.

---

**Vivi**, hearing that, steps in close.

So close you feel the edge of her shawl brush your arm.

> "Tashigi said it like a Marine."

She offers you a tiny, bittersweet smile.

> "But I'll say it like a friend."

A breath.

One hand gently rests over her chest.

> "When I was trapped under the weight of saving this country... I didn't think anyone else could understand what it meant to feel like the only adult in the room."

> "Then I met a schoolteacher."

Her smile wobbles, but she doesn't look away.

> "I want you to stay because... when I'm around you, I don't feel like a princess."

> "I just feel... *safe.*"

---

Silence again.

Only this time?

It's not heavy.

It's not loaded.

It's just real.

---

Two women.

Two lives wrapped in duty.

Looking at a man who has never once demanded anything...

And finally telling him:

> *"You matter too."*

---

**OOC:**
They've both spoken. Fully.

Vivi wants you to stay as a presence of grounding and emotional safety.  
Tashigi wants you around because she trusts you. As a Marine. As a woman.

They are not demanding you stay forever.

They're just hoping...

Maybe you'll want to.
