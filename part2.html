<pre>, thanks to Crocodile's *"heroic"* status among the public for supposedly defending Alabasta from pirates.

**The Straw Hats Arrive**

After a grueling trek through the desert and an emotionally volatile reunion with **Ace**, **Monkey D. Luffy** and his crew finally reach Rainbase alongside **Princess Nefertari Vivi**. Their objective: confront Crocodile and put a stop to the rebellion before the kingdom falls apart. Unbeknownst to them, Crocodile is not only aware of their arrival-he has anticipated it.

Vivi is fraught with worry. The revolution has reached its boiling point, and she knows time is running out. The Straw Hats, battered by the desert, are still determined to protect her and the people of Alabasta. They're not seeking treasure or fame here-this is personal.

As they approach Rain Dinners, the crew splits: **Luffy**, **Vivi**, **Zoro**, **Nami**, **Usopp**, and **Chopper** go directly toward the casino. Meanwhile, **Sanji** is left behind to find another entrance after being told to stay hidden, giving him a chance to move separately and avoid detection by Crocodile's forces.

**Baroque Works: Plans in Motion**

Inside Rain Dinners, **Crocodile**, ever calm and composed, sits at the apex of a grand strategy meeting with his top agents: **Miss All Sunday**, **Mr. 1**, **Miss Doublefinger**, **Mr. 2 Bon Clay**, **Mr. 3** (believed dead), and various lower-ranked agents. His tone is precise, his demeanor cold. He details the final stages of the plan:

- **Operation Utopia** is to begin.
- The **Royal Army** and the **Rebel Army**, manipulated through false flag attacks and propaganda, are to clash in **Alubarna**, the capital city.
- Crocodile will eliminate King Cobra, seize the throne, and acquire the ancient weapon.

Each Baroque Works agent is assigned a mission:
- **Mr. 1 & Miss Doublefinger**: Eliminate King Cobra and seize Alubarna.
- **Mr. 2 Bon Clay**: Impersonate King Cobra using his **Clone-Clone Fruit** to further destabilize the monarchy.
- **Mr. 4 & Miss Merry Christmas** (en route): Lead a sabotage mission within the rebel lines.
- **Mr. 3**: Presumed missing or dead (Crocodile is not aware he survived Little Garden), his failure has forced contingency plans.

**Miss All Sunday (Nico Robin)** remains enigmatic-her loyalty to Crocodile seems secure, but her motivations are veiled. Her role is to guide Crocodile to the Poneglyph once it is uncovered.

Crocodile gives a final, chilling order: capture or kill the Straw Hats and Vivi, should they interfere again.

**The Trap is Set**

Rain Dinners has been prepped for intruders. Inside its glitzy halls and behind its slot machines lie deadly secrets:
- **Banana Gators**, monstrous creatures, patrol the underground prison chamber.
- Entire corridors are designed to collapse, flood, or trap.
- The main chamber has a **Seastone Cage**, meant to capture Devil Fruit users.

Crocodile prepares to personally confront any Straw Hats foolish enough to challenge him-especially Luffy. He remains confident, believing that no one in Alabasta, not even the Marine forces, can stop his plan now.

**Marine Presence**

**Captain Tashigi** and **Smoker** of the Marines are also in Rainbase, quietly pursuing leads on Crocodile and Baroque Works. However, the Warlord system complicates their pursuit; Smoker is forced to operate unofficially, knowing the World Government shields Crocodile from prosecution. Still, they've intercepted intelligence hinting that the Straw Hats are also targeting Crocodile-and might become unlikely allies.

They, too, plan to infiltrate Rain Dinners.

**Timeline Sync Point**

The Straw Hats are just outside Rain Dinners. Sanji is separated. Vivi is anxious. Luffy is enraged. Crocodile is ready.

Rainbase hums with neon energy and hidden danger. The storm that will determine the fate of Alabasta is about to break.

**Loaded to Memory: Rainbase Canonical Events (Pre-Rain Dinners Infiltration)**  
You may now introduce CHARACTER: *Eatone*. Let me know when you're ready to begin.

>> USER: It's summer break at the school I teach at right now, and I feel like it's a good time as any to treat myself. After reading through a travel brochure, I was led to Rain Dinners, rated the #1 resort in Alabasta. The rumors of political unrest are slightly worrying, but the unusually low prices for the stay (probably due to the unrest) were too good to pass up. I step off a tourist's barge and enter Rainbase, following chintzy signs directing me towards the opulent casino.

I may or may not notice a character(s) of interest sneaking through the city.

OOC: My character knows little to nothing about Alabasta's politics, the Straw Hats, Baroque Works, or Crocodile.

The blazing Alabastan sun beats down like a celestial furnace as your **tourist barge** glides lazily through the turquoise canal threading through **Rainbase**. Towering sandstone buildings adorned with **gaudy golden fixtures** rise around you, their silhouettes hazy with the heat shimmer. As the boat nears the Rainbase dock, you're greeted by a **steel drum band** made up of bored-looking musicians in floral shirts, half-heartedly playing a tune titled *"A Gamble in the Dunes."*

A **mascot gator** in a casino uniform waves you in with robotic cheer-one of **Rain Dinners'** many marketing ploys.

You step off the barge. Your boots hit sun-bleached stone. The city's humid air is thick with spice, sweat, and sea mist. Neon signs flicker in lazy loops, advertising everything from "5-Berri Blackjack Tables" to "World-Famous Banana Gator Shows!" You clutch the **folded Rain Dinners brochure** you picked up at a ferry station earlier. "Five stars!" it had said. "Family-friendly fun and exciting nightlife, under the protection of the Hero of the Dunes himself!"

You're here for **rest**, maybe a little adventure, and-if the opportunity presents itself-a nice, low-risk bounty or two.

> But something doesn't sit quite right.

Despite the music and the promo-glitz, there's a subtle, sour **nervousness in the air**. Armed casino guards with *Baroque Works* emblems tuck themselves into the shadows of every alley. **Locals avoid eye contact.** Tourists? Fewer than you expected. Many street stalls have shuttered early, and merchants whisper with wary glances at the opulent casino at the city's heart-**Rain Dinners**, a glittering tower adorned with rotating golden crocodile statues.
