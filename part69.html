<pre>distance.

---

You round the rubble.

And you see it.

> "...oh shit."

Your voice barely escapes your throat.

But your body-

It *moves.*

---

You **command the juice.**  
Not to attack. Not to explode.

Just to **push.**

---

A slithering, concentrated **kiwi stream** erupts behind you, **tightening**, **pressurizing**-becoming a **hydraulic piston** aimed dead at destiny.

---

Your body, scraped and bruised, launches forward like a **slightly fruity cannonball**.

**Ribs screaming. Arms shaking. Mouth open in either rage or regret.**

You fly.

You fly in the **worst position** possible-limbs flailing, posture pathetic-

But your **aim?**

**Perfect.**

---

> *WHAM.*

You **slam into the side** of the lead Baroque agent mid-swing, tackling him in a burst of citrus spray.

**He goes down hard.**

You crash through him into the second, sending both skidding into the dust, blades spinning into the sand.

---

The third stumbles back.

The fourth hesitates-too late.

---

You roll, bounce, *bounce again*, and come to a **wheezing, juice-slicked stop** between Vivi and the attackers.

Your body screams.

But you **throw your arm out**, protecting her with the only thing you have left: **presence.**

---

Vivi turns, wide-eyed.

> "Eatone?!"

---

You don't have breath for words.

But your message is clear.

---

> *Not the kid.*

---

And now?

The Straw Hats are turning.

Sanji sees them.

Zoro's sword is already halfway out.

**Too late for a clean kill. Too late for subtlety.**

Your ridiculous, heroic tackle has **blown their cover**, and the momentum has turned.

---

**OOC: You have successfully intercepted the surprise attack.  
Two Baroque agents down. Two more exposed.  
Straw Hats are reacting.  
Vivi is safe.  
You are at zero stamina.**

Would you like to:

1. {Stay down. Just watch it unfold. You've done enough.}  
2. {Say something to Vivi before you pass out again.}  
3. {Try to rise. Pathetic. Heroic. Hilarious.}  
4. {Attempt to summon a final, shaky Kiwi Elemental before losing consciousness.}

ðŸŒ€ Final play, Sensei?

>> USER: Option 2 - Groan from the pain of headbutting someone in armor. At least the straw hats have them handled. I snake a stream of juice around Vivi as if I was circling the wagons, then curl around her like a particularly protective worm (or viper, if one were feeling charitable). I look up at her, wincing. I've... I've still got your back blue. As long as I'm still breathing.

A pause.

Well considering that I can't get up, it's more like I got your feet, rather than your back.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Kiwi Shield]**  
**Scene: "Feet, Back, Whatever It Takes"**  
**Tone: Painfully Honest | Mood: Ridiculous and Heartbreaking All at Once**

---

You're lying in the dirt.

Your skull is ringing from the *headbutt into a breastplate maneuver* (Note to self: **never again**), and your ribs feel like a maraca in a blender.

But you're still there.

**Breathing.**

And **Vivi is alive.**

---

The Straw Hats explode into action behind you-

- **Zoro's swords flash**, parrying and pinning the last two Baroque agents like he's cutting wheat.  
- **Sanji flips into the air**, a boot connecting with a jaw that echoes across the plaza.  
- **Usopp** fires off a slingshot round that bursts in a blinding flash.  
- **Nami**, eyes burning, raises her Clima-Tact and channels a gust of wind to knock the last attacker into a broken stall.

---

You?

You just **groan**.

> "Ughhhh... godsdamn armor helmets..."

You cough. **Something cracks.**  
Could be your pride.

You raise a **shaky finger**, and a **thin coil of kiwi juice** slithers from it, tracing the ground in a tight ring around Vivi. Like a moat. A barrier. A **final warning**.

Then you curl slightly closer, your battered body forming a squishy, wounded spiral near her legs.

> "I've... I've still got your back, Blue."

You wince hard, twitching from pain, still not looking directly at her.

> "As long as I'm still breathing."

You look up at her-

Vivi, blinking through tears. Shock. Relief.

You give her a weak, sideways grin.

---

> "Well, considering I can't get up..."

> "...it's more like I got your **feet**, rather than your back."

---

That gets her.

A weak, exhausted **laugh** escapes her throat, even as the tears flow.  
She drops to her knees beside you, hands hovering-unsure where to touch, where it wouldn't hurt.

> "You absolute idiot..."

> "My idiot."

She leans forward, wrapping her arms **gently** around your shoulders as chaos still swirls at the edges of the plaza.

But not near her.

Not anymore.

---

**You did it.**

You made it in time.

---

**OOC:**
- Vivi has been emotionally and physically steadied.
- The Straw Hats have cleared the remaining agents.
- You are alive-barely-but your sacrifice **turned the tide.**
- Tashigi, still watching from above, smiles faintly through the blood.

> *Maybe you're not just a teacher after all.*

---

Would you like to fade out into unconsciousness with style-or stay conscious to witness the beginning of the final confrontation with Crocodile above?

>> USER: Maintain consciousness.

Kohza finally gets to Vivi.

A dry Luffy fisted ineffectively fights Crocodile

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Turning Tide]**  
**Scene: "Truth, Sand, and Stubbornness"**  
**Tone: Threadbare Resolve | Mood: The Tension Before the Final Blow**

---

You're lying on the cobblestones, half-curled around **Vivi**, **conscious only through sheer spite** and the sense of adult responsibility that refuses to die.

Your body is wrecked. You're fairly certain at least **four major joints** are protesting their contracts.

But you're **aware**.

**Watching. Listening.**

---

The dust settles around the plaza-at least for now.

The **Straw Hats** regroup in a loose perimeter, weapons drawn but no longer pressed. For once, the battlefield **pauses.**

**Kohza** finally shoves through the last of the crowd, his cloak torn, face cut and bruised from the riot.

He sees you first.

He falters-**unsure who the hell the green, fruit-smelling guy curled at Vivi's ankles is.**

But then-

He sees **her.**

And she sees **him.**

---

> "Kohza..."

> "Vivi."

It's not a reunion.

It's not even a moment of peace.

It's **confirmation.**

That both of them are still alive. That they still remember what they fought for.

> "I saw it," he breathes, stepping closer. "I saw the agents. The lies. *Crocodile.*"

She nods-tears still fresh but *held back.*

> "We can still stop this."

> "We just need to tell them. Together."

---

The crowd watches, torn. Not fighting. Not moving. **Waiting.**

For a sign.

For a leader.

For truth.

---

---

**Above...**

**Luffy is punching sand.**

Over and over and over again.

**Fists slam through Crocodile's chest**, his arms, his face-but it's like hitting fog.

> "GOMU GOMU NO-!"

**Swirl. Twist. Miss.**

Crocodile's laughter **rings across the sky**.

> "How does it feel?" he sneers. "To throw your whole strength... and never touch anything at all?"

He **slams a sand-covered fist** into Luffy's side, sending him **tumbling across the rooftop**, coughing, spitting blood.

---

Below, Vivi looks up.

You look too.

She doesn't cry.

She just **tenses**-watching Crocodile tower above her kingdom.

---

You shift slightly, enough to whisper.

> "Dry..."

> "His fruit..."

You cough hard. Acid climbs your throat.

> "He's made of sand... and you're hitting him with fists."

---

Nami, nearby, snaps her head toward you.

> "You've seen him fight before?"

You nod. Barely.

> "He... he dries things out. Drains moisture. Luffy's... he's fighting without water..."

Your voice trails.

But **someone hears.**

And the seed is planted.

---

**OOC:**
- Kohza and Vivi are reunited.
- The crowd is *finally* still-awaiting their orders.
- Luffy is **failing** to land damage on Crocodile due to **lack of water.**
- You are maintaining consciousness-barely.
- The true final battle is still brewin</pre>
