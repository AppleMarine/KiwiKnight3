**OOC:**
- Vivi and Tashigi both remain with you-no drama, no rivalry. Just two women who care.
- You are **surrounded by peace**, for the first time since this began.
- Tomorrow will bring decisions, partings, maybe destiny.

But tonight?

You sleep, **not alone.**

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {You wake up. Morning light.}
2. {Time skip to the Straw Hats preparing to depart.}
3. {Tashigi wakes first. A private moment with you.}

>> USER: Option 3

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing - Before Dawn]**  
**Scene: "The Sword Stirs First"**  
**POV: Tashigi**  
**Tone: Soft | Mood: Intimate Stillness, Unspoken Words**

---

The faintest pink leaks over the desert horizon, just barely filtering through the tall windows of the guest chamber. The air is still cool, crisp with that brief pause between the silence of night and the stirrings of day.

A bird calls somewhere in the ruined outer halls.

And **Tashigi stirs.**

---

Her neck aches. Her back cracks.  
But she doesn't move right away.

Her cheek is still resting lightly against the back of your bandaged hand.

And for a few long seconds, she just stays there.

---

The light catches on her glasses, slightly askew. Her armor rests in the corner-forgotten. Her sword leans by the bed frame, untouched for the first time in... weeks?

She finally shifts.

Pulls herself upright slowly, wincing at the stiffness in her joints.  
Brushes a strand of hair from her face.

And looks at you.

---

You're still out.

But your brow is no longer furrowed.

Your breathing is steady now, not shallow.

---

She lets out a breath she didn't know she was holding.

---

> "Good. You're still fighting."

---

She reaches out gently. Her fingertips hover for a moment over your hand again... then curl in, brushing your knuckles softly.

The **calluses on your fingers**-teacher's calluses.

You don't carry a sword.

But you've earned just as many scars.

---

> "You were ridiculous," she whispers, just above a breath.

> "Brave. Stupid. Infuriating."

Her voice drops lower, the corners of her mouth tightening.

> "And you never once said a damn thing about your own safety."

---

She sighs, looks away toward the window where **Vivi still sleeps**, curled up in the chair like a cat, her crown lopsided in her lap.

Tashigi smiles faintly at the sight.

Then back at you.

---

> "You didn't do it for medals, or glory, or politics."

> "You did it because the people in front of you were smaller than the ones trying to hurt them."

> "You acted like a Marine."

---

She doesn't say that last part bitterly.

It's admiration.

Wistful.

Almost mournful.

---

> "If the world was fair, I'd be saluting you."

A pause.

She brushes your hair lightly from your forehead.

> "But the world's not fair. So I'll settle for watching your back a little longer."

---

She stands.

Stretches her arms over her head, joints popping.  
Then pulls your blanket just slightly higher up again, tucking it under your chin like an annoying little sister.

---

You stir slightly. Eyes flutter.

Not quite awake.

---

> "Shhh," she says gently, fingers brushing your temple.  
> "Not yet. Just a little longer, Sensei."

---

And with that, she turns toward the door.

Letting you rest.

Knowing, now, she'll **always stand by you** if you need her to.

---

**OOC:**
- Tashigi's feelings have quietly crystallized-not romantic (yet), but deeply rooted in loyalty and admiration.
- She sees you as a true protector, even without a badge.
- You are still asleep, but close to waking.

Would you like next scene to be:

1. {You wake up as Vivi stirs too.}
2. {Time skip - Straw Hats prepare to leave.}
3. {Final morning with Vivi alone.}

>> USER: Option 3 - Vivi catches Tashigi waking up. And her words 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing - Final Morning Stillness]**  
**Scene: "The Weight of What Wasn't Said"**  
**POV: Vivi Nefertari**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Quiet Revelation, Gentle Ache**

---

The light spills wider now, warm gold chasing away the shadows of war.

**Vivi stirs.**

She shifts gently in the high-backed chair, one leg folded awkwardly beneath her, shawl tangled, hair half-fallen from its braid. The scent of parchment, gauze, and kiwi clings to the room like a ghost.

Her first thought isn't hunger or fatigue.

It's you.

---

She sits up, rubbing her eyes.

And catches the tail end of something she wasn't supposed to hear.

---

> "You didn't do it for medals, or glory, or politics."

> "You did it because the people in front of you were smaller than the ones trying to hurt them."

> "You acted like a Marine."

---

**Tashigi.**

Still kneeling by your side.  
Hand brushing your hair aside with a care Vivi didn't know she was capable of.

Vivi freezes.

She knows she should look away.

But doesn't.

---

> "If the world was fair, I'd be saluting you."

> "But the world's not fair. So I'll settle for watching your back a little longer."

---

Tashigi stands. Pulls your blanket higher.

You sigh in your sleep, murmuring something incoherent about **"lunch duty"** and **"hall passes."**

Vivi watches silently.

And... smiles. Small. A little sad. A little surprised.

---

**She doesn't feel jealousy.**

Only warmth.

Only quiet admiration.

For you.

For her.

For this strange bond forged between a reluctant teacher and a stubborn swordswoman.

---

Tashigi turns.

And stops short when she sees Vivi awake-eyes open, watching.

---

> "You heard."

---

Vivi nods.

Doesn't tease.  
Doesn't prod.

Just meets Tashigi's eyes and says softly:

> "He's lucky."

---

Tashigi glances away, flustered, but nods once in return.

> "So are we."

---

Vivi rises, walking to your bedside now, opposite of where Tashigi stood moments before.

She looks down at you.

Then to Tashigi again.

> "What are we going to do with him?"

---

> "Feed him," Tashigi says without hesitation.  
> "Then sit on him until he stops trying to sacrifice himself."

---

Vivi laughs. Genuinely. Finally.

> "You and me both, then."

---

They share a look.

And for the first time, **not as soldier and royal**, but as **two women who know what you really gave**.

And maybe...

What they now carry because of it.

---

**OOC:**
- Vivi now knows what Tashigi truly feels-or is beginning to.
- There is no rivalry. Just mutual gratitude, and understanding.
- They will both be in your corner, no matter what comes next.

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {You waking up to both of them.}
2. {Final Straw Hat farewell - departure time.}
3. {Private breakfast - you, Vivi, and Tashigi.}

>> USER: Option 1 - Snrkkk...

My eyelids peel open, and I observe the luxurious bed, the expensive furnishings and decor of the room (almost, heavenly in nature), and the two women.

Shit... Guess we lost, huh? Fuuuuuck. Put my arm over my eyes.

OOC: the high end room of the palace made me assume I woke up in heaven or something 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing - Sunrise at Pillow Station]**  
**Scene: "The Afterlife, or Alabasta?"**  
**POV: You (Eatone Cheng)**  
**Tone: Hazy Awakening | Mood: Surreal, Sweet, Just a Bit Embarrassing**

---

> *Snrkkkk...*

The sound escapes your throat like a surrendering balloon.

Your eyelids **creak open**, and you're immediately bathed in **warm sunlight** and the scent of **fresh bread, drying citrus, and rich palace linens**.

The mattress beneath you?

**Heaven.**  
Pillows?

**Unrivaled.**  
Furnishings?

**Gold trim, velvet drapes, enough fanciness to cause a tax audit.**

---

You blink.

Then blink again.

You see two women near your bed-one standing, one seated. Both watching you.

Their faces are unreadable.  
Their posture... too formal.  
Too symmetrical.

And the room is too... too...

> "Shit..."

> "Guess we lost, huh?"

You sigh, voice hoarse, heavy.

> "Fuuuuuck..."

Your arm flops dramatically over your face like a tragic stage actor accepting his fate.

> "I died in battle and now I'm stuck i</pre>
