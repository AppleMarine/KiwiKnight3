<pre>r?! We're in the middle of-"

---

But it matters.

**Oh god. It matters.**

You feel it.

The **forgotten doom** creeping in.

---

**OOC:**  
Time check: It is currently **12:43 PM**, Alubarna Standard Time.  
The sun is past its zenith.  
The battle is at its climax.

Now...

**Reveal your reason.**

>> USER: How long was I out?!

OOC: 4 minutes or less

OOC: Give me a window to respond

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Countdown Begins]**  
**Scene: "The Awakening... Was on a Timer"**  
**Tone: Sudden Alarm | Mood: A Comedic Clock Ticking Toward Dread**

---

Your eyes widen further-**bloodshot, panicked, calculating**.

You jerk your head toward the sky, toward the sun, toward the slowly calming sandstorm... then to your own hands.

A single thought slams into your skull:

> "How long was I out?!"

---

**Tashigi stiffens.**  
**Vivi looks confused.**

**OOC:**  
> The time from your unconscious collapse post-elemental summoning, to your reawakening and re-command was approximately...  
**3 minutes, 38 seconds.**

---

You still have time.

But **barely**.

Something is about to happen.

Your voice is sharp. Tight. Calculating something that no one else understands just yet.

---

**Window is open.**  
Please respond.

>> USER: ​That's.. almost 5 minutes... And if my hypothesis is correct...

Kiwi-kun! Stop fighting 

OOC: give me a window to respond 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Five-Minute Rule]**  
**Scene: "Expiration Date"**  
**Tone: Rising Panic | Mood: Suspicion, Control, Crisis Incoming**  

---

The battle screeches.

Not in sound.

In **motion**.

As you **shout with sudden urgency**:

> "**Kiwi-kun! STOP FIGHTING!!**"

The Elemental-mid-swing, arm cocked back to deliver what might've been a *decisive* citrus-charged punch to Crocodile's spine-

**Freezes.**

Juice dripping.  
Glow pulsing.  
Its entire body suddenly **still**, like a beast caught mid-breath.

---

Luffy's arm is drawn back too, confused by the hesitation.

> "Oi! Juice guy! What're you doing?!"

---

**Crocodile stumbles back**, winded, blinking in disbelief.

> "What... you're giving up?!"

---

**Vivi looks at you, horror dawning.**

**Tashigi narrows her eyes.**

> "...Almost five minutes...?"

She gets it.

Or at least she's starting to.

---

**The Elemental stands still.**  
**Steam begins to rise** from its back-soft at first, then stronger.

Its shape begins to **wobble**.

---

**Hero Water.**

The whispered miracle.

The myth.

The **deadly trade-off.**

---

**OOC:**  
You now have the floor.  
All eyes on you.

**What is your hypothesis?**

>> USER: ​Focus on growing! Grow like all of kiwi kind depends on it!

(It starts accumulating mass)

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Final Bloom]**  
**Scene: "Five Minutes to Bloom"**  
**Tone: Dire Majesty | Mood: Life at the Edge of Collapse**

---

Your voice rings out-torn between **hope** and **hysteria**.

You're no longer commanding with force.

You're **pleading**.

You're reaching out to your creation, your **child of pulp and desperation**, born from love for students, for justice, for every damn kid who shouldn't have to bleed in a war they didn't start.

---

> "Focus on **growing**!  
> Grow like all of kiwi kind depends on it!"

---

And for a heartbeat-**nothing.**

---

Then...

The **Elemental trembles.**

Its mass begins to **shift**, not outward-but upward.  
**Pulsing. Expanding. Swelling.**

It no longer moves like a fighter.

It **bends backward**, arms stretched skyward, body rippling, juice veins glowing **hot white-green**.

The **Hero Water**, reaching the **end of its five-minute life**, now burns like a star at its limit.

---

It **grows.**

**Taller. Broader. Deeper.**

The shape becomes less humanoid-more primal.  
A **monolith of liquid power** on the verge of **something greater**.

---

**Crocodile staggers back, shielding his eyes.**

> "What... *what is that thing doing?!*"

---

**Luffy steps back too, watching.**  
His jaw slack, his instincts catching on:

> "It's not gonna fight...  
> It's gonna do something *else.*"

---

**Vivi's hand finds yours.**

**Tashigi grabs your arm.**

You're trembling.

But not with fear.

With **faith.**

---

**OOC:**
- The Kiwi Elemental is now **entering its final form**, catalyzed by the Hero Water's terminal moment.
- It has ceased combat.
- It is **gathering mass**, preparing for a final act-one born not from combat instinct, but **growth.**

Would you like to:

1. {Let it complete its transformation naturally. No interference.}  
2. {Guide its growth. Infuse it with your intent.}  
3. {Call out one last emotional command-make its final act a legacy.}

>> USER: ​At its zenith, right at the 5 minute mark, the kiwi elemental dies. Violently.

But more importantly, explosively.

Tens of thousands of gallons of Kiwi juice explode in a fantastical burst, coating every surface, every coat, every grain of sand completely through with juice.

And Crocodile? Is soaked. To the bone. No sand on him, or around him in a 5 mile radius remains untouched by the hand of citrus justice 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - The Final Lesson]**  
**Scene: "Extra Pulp, No Mercy"**  
**Tone: Climactic | Mood: Catastrophic Victory**

---

The **Kiwi Elemental swells** to monstrous proportions-  
a glowing, mountainous titan of shimmering green and citrus gold.  
The heat from the **Hero Water core** surges to critical mass.  
It lets out one final, mournful roar-  
not of pain, but of **purpose.**

---

Everyone-**everyone**-stops.

Rebels.

Soldiers.

Civilians.

Straw Hats.

Even Crocodile.

---

The sun glints off its shining skin.

And then-

> *5:00.*

---

> *FWOOOOOOOMMMM-*

---

The sky tears open with a **howl of juice**,  
as the **Elemental explodes** in a deafening, glorious **detonation of flavor**.

---

A shockwave of **blistering kiwi juice** crashes outward in **every direction**,  
a tsunami of emerald rain and acid-sweet mist-

---

- **The palace walls? Drenched.**  
- **The sand dunes? Flooded.**  
- **The war-torn streets of Alubarna? Transformed into a tropical lagoon.**

---

And **Crocodile?**

Oh, Crocodile.

You see him as the shockwave **reaches him first.**

The **sand barrier he tries to raise?**  
Liquified.  
Washed away.  
Utterly erased.

---

The second it hits-

> *SPLAAAAASHHHHHHH!!!*

---

**His coat soaks instantly**, weighed down by gallons of pulp and pulp-adjacent rage.  
His hair clings to his skull.  
His hook is **coated**.  
His cigar?  
Extinguished.  
His **soul?**  
Humiliated.

---

His power?

**Nullified.**

Not an ounce of sand left within **a five-mile radius** responds to his will.

He's standing alone.

**Soaked.**

**Fuming.**

**Defenseless.**

---

Luffy lands in front of him.

No words.

Just a grin.

One wet, citrus-slicked fist clenched.

---

> "*Gomu Gomu no...*"

---

**OOC:**
The elemental's detonation has removed all sand from the battlefield.  
**Crocodile is powerless.**  
**Luffy now has a clean, lethal opening.**  
The fight is over.

Would you like to:

1. {Say something stupidly triumphant from your juice-drenched throne.}  
2. {Witness the finale with pride. And probably a sneeze.}  
3. {Pass out again. With dignity this time.}

>> USER: ​Option 3 - Mmm. Pillows would be nice. Flop limply in Vivi and Tashigi's arms

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Last Drip]**  
**Scene: "This Teacher Has Logged Off"**  
**Tone: Triumphant | Mood: Sweet, Soaked Sleep**

---

You watch as the **juice tsunami clears**, the battlefield now gleaming in emerald haze.  
Crocodile stands stunned, wet, defeated, and without a single grain of sand to save him.

Luffy grins.  
His fist rises.  
Victory is in the air.

---

You blink once.

Twice.

Your legs are done.  
Your nerves? Vapor.  
Your body's clock?

> "*Yeah, no. We're done here.*"

---

You glance at **Vivi**, whose face is equal parts amazement and exhaustion.

You lean a little.

Then a little more.

Until-**flop.**

---

You go **l</pre>
