<pre>ns**, one with **sea prism handcuffs**, and one guy pretending to be a tourist while palming something under his coat.

You **pass by several clusters of patrons**, noting potential NPCs:

### 👥 Notable Casino Patrons (Visible)
- A **large, bald man in a crimson sash**, surrounded by a small entourage, aggressively playing a game of sand-craps and yelling, "KING COBRA AIN'T GOT SHIT ON MY LUCK!"
- A **hooded figure** near the pachinko machines... who keeps glancing over his shoulder like someone's watching *him*.
- A pair of tourists making out in a dark corner-**one of them has a Baroque Works tattoo on their neck**, mostly hidden under a scarf.
- A hunched old woman with sharp, intelligent eyes, **writing on a napkin** and muttering numbers.

And then-

As you pass by the **poker tables**, something twitches at the edge of your Devil Fruit senses.

**Kiwi juice resonates** faintly near the **VIP corridor** beyond a velvet rope. A small trace-a moisture displacement ripple, like something organic recently moved through at speed. Your trained nose catches a whiff of sweat, animal dander, and a *faint berry-sugar trail.*

It's that little **blue-nosed reindeer again**.

You didn't see him go in-but his scent is fresh. He, or one of the Straw Hats, must have **snuck past security.**

Then, a chill up your spine. You turn just in time to see a man at the far end of the hall lower his newspaper.

**Square jaw. Glaring eyes. A silver-gray cigar hangs from his mouth.**  
He locks eyes with you, briefly.

**It's *Smoker the White Hunter.***  
You blink-and he's gone, like mist.

> Was that real? Or has this place finally gotten to you?

---

**📝 Updates:**

- At least **one Straw Hat crew member is inside Rain Dinners**, near or beyond the VIP section.
- You may have just seen **Captain Smoker**, or someone impersonating him.
- Your movement hasn't gone unnoticed. A **security agent** (dressed as a patron) is now subtly trailing you from the drinks kiosk.
- This place is a lot *deeper* than a normal casino.

**Time: Night Proper | Casino Fully Operational | Security Level: Medium**  
**Current Status: Undetected by hostiles, but on soft watch**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Try to sneak past the velvet rope and investigate the VIP hallway. Maybe Chopper-or another Straw Hat-is deeper inside.}
2. {Approach the hunched old woman muttering to herself. She may be counting cards... or hiding information.}
3. {Confront the security agent tailing you-but make it casual, like you just bumped into him. See what he's really watching.}
4. {Exit the casino floor and head toward the docks now. Too much is building up in here-you need outside air, and maybe a kebab.}
5. {Head back toward the aquarium. See if you can spot Smoker again-or confirm if what you saw was real.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 3 - I blink, trying to see if my eyes were tricking me about seeing the Marine Captain. I've heard of him in the news.

Observe the security guard tailing me.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 3 Selected - "Wait... was that *Smoker*? No, focus. Who's this tailing me?"**  
**🕵️‍♂️ Passive Check: Famous Faces Recognition - (Eatone +1 Careful, +1 Lore/Newsroll) = Result: 4 [Good]**  
**🎲 Observation Check on Security Tail - (Eatone +2 Careful +1 Subtle Kiwi Juice Sensory) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**🎲 Opposed Roll - Tail's Stealth (Skilled Agent: +2 Deceit, +1 Bluff) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**✅ Outcome: SUCCESS - You ID the tail and gain leverage on him without exposing yourself**

**You blink**, the casino's lights warping around you in a prismatic blur of glitter, neon, and tension. That had to be **Smoker**-*The White Hunter*, Marine Captain, notorious for going off-script and chasing pirates like a bloodhound through bureaucratic red tape.

You've read about him in the **World Economy News Paper**, usually buried under headlines about sea battles and rising bounties. *"Justice Obsessed Marine Tracks Pirates Through The Grand Line - Collateral Damage Unknown."*

> *"If he's here... then this place is even more messed up than I thought."*

But you file it away. Right now, **someone else is watching you.**

You reach for your juice senses-pressing your fingers to the inside of your palm like you're cracking a knuckle-and feel the **moisture ripple around a nearby drink station.** Kiwi Juice molecules split across your skin in hair-thin tendrils, mimicking the humidity of the air... and **you catch him.**

### 🎯 Target: Undercover Security Tail
- **Male, mid-thirties**, faux-stubble that looks too perfect to be natural.
- Wearing a **patterned short-sleeve shirt**, holding a tourist drink he hasn't sipped once.
- His eyes? Watching reflections in mirrors. Watching *you*.
- Under his shirt: a **hidden baton holster**, left hip. Just like yours-except *not Seastone-tipped.*

You slow your pace, then fake a pause at a card table, acting like you're deciding whether or not to bet. As you do, you feel a surge of professional satisfaction.

> He's good. But not *teacher-on-break, battle-trained bounty hunter with Devil Fruit intuition* good.

Then-he flinches.

Just a little. He knows you spotted him. You catch the tiny adjustment in posture: his feet shift. His drink hand tightens. **He's bracing.**

> If you approach now, you have the upper hand.

---

**📝 You've Gained:**

- **Visual confirmation of your tail**, including weapon placement and likely training level.
- He works for the **Rain Dinners private security team**, probably linked directly to Baroque Works.
- He's not here to eject you-*yet.* Most likely observing your path and checking your loyalty.
- You're still technically "safe," but now *dancing at the edge of the crocodile's jaw.*

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Approach casually. "Hey there. You watching me or the girl at the bar?" Make it playful, but let him know *you see him*.}
2. {Pull a sudden maneuver-spill your drink, fake a stumble, test how quickly he reacts. See if he's wired to subdue or just watch.}
3. {Move toward the back of the casino where foot traffic is heavier. Lose him in the crowd and slip away toward the VIP hall.}
4. {Leave the casino floor entirely and head to the west docks. Whatever's happening here, you now know you're not the only agent.}
5. {Use your Devil Fruit: secretly deposit a slick, invisible kiwi juice trail across the floor behind you-if he follows, he'll trip. Juice trap roll required.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 1 - I... is this a problem with my reservation? I'm pretty sure I booked the correct dates when I made it.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected - "Oh no... is this a *reservation* issue?"**  
**🎭 Tone: Naïve Tourist + Light Anxiety = Expert Bluff Disarmament**  
**🎲 Social Roll - Honest Confusion Gambit: (Eatone +2 Rapport, +1 Situational Plausibility) = 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Security Agent Bluff Resistance: +1 Training, -2 Caught Off Guard = -1 [Terrible]**  
**🎯 Outcome: CRITICAL SUCCESS - Tail mentally disarms, lowers guard, and assumes you're a soft target**

---

You turn, drink still in hand (untouched, of course), and approach the tailing man with a polite, slightly distressed expression that would melt any customer service rep's will to live.

> "Hi, uh, sorry-excuse me?" you say, half-sheepish.  
> "You've been watching me for the past few minutes, and I just wanna ask... is this a problem with my reservation?"

You flash him your **Rain Dinners room keycard** and the **used drink voucher**, the very picture of a confused man just trying to have a normal vacation while resisting a world-class mental breakdown.

The tail blinks.

He stiffens, shoulders tensing... then rapidly *untenses* as the situation hits him all at once. You can *see* it:

> *"Ah, damn. Just another over-cautious sweep. He's just some schoolteacher from another island. Probably thinks this place is a real resort."*

He forces a short laugh-*too short*-and shakes his head like he's emba</pre>
