<pre>p of war-your voice cuts the tension.

Not with tactics.

Not with bravado.

But with something real.

> "So, Blue..."

You turn your head slightly toward her.

> "Mind telling me why you seem to be running a one-princess crusade against a Warlord of the Sea?"

> "Because from where I'm sitting, that's either the bravest thing I've ever seen...  
or the dumbest."

---

**Vivi doesn't answer immediately.**

Her duck's pace slows a little, her posture tightening-not out of pride, but something more fragile.

Something *earnest.*

You don't push.  
You wait.

You've taught enough kids to know **when silence means the words are still being chosen.**

---

Finally, she speaks.

> "Because no one else would."

Her voice is low. Controlled. But tired.

> "Because when the droughts started... and the rebellions rose...  
the people looked to the palace for answers."

> "And we had none."

---

She looks down at the reins. Her knuckles are white.

> "Baroque Works infiltrated everything. Every layer. Every trusted name.  
My father tried diplomacy. The council wanted appeasement."

> "But Crocodile didn't want peace."

A pause.

> "He wanted to *break* us. Quietly. Slowly. From the inside out."

---

You glance at her again.

Not as a pirate's ally.  
Not as a princess.

Just a **girl**-weighed down by a crown, standing at the edge of a nation's collapse.

---

She breathes in.

> "So I did the only thing I could."

> "I joined them."

Her hand tightens on the saddlehorn.

> "Baroque Works. I worked my way up their ranks, took a codename.  
I fed intel to the palace. I tried to stop him from the inside."

---

Then, quieter:

> "But I wasn't strong enough."

> "So I ran."

> "And I met them."  
She nods toward the Straw Hats ahead.

> "And now I'm here."

---

The gates are open now.

The city waits.

And Vivi looks at you.

> "I'm not trying to be a hero."

> "I just want my home back."

---

**OOC: You now know Vivi's secret.  
She was once **Miss Wednesday**, an undercover agent embedded in Baroque Works.

She didn't volunteer for war.

She volunteered for **her people**.

And now, you're riding beside someone who's sacrificed more than most monarchs *ever* would.**

Would you like to say something back? Or ride in silence beside her as the city swallows you whole?

>> USER: Hold on. Hold the fuck on.

I point at her. You, princess. Not even an adult yet (and years ago, when you were even younger). Joined an organized crime syndicate? 

The fuck? That doesn't add up.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Gates - Reality Check from the Sub]**  
**Scene: "The Moment the Teacher Snaps"**  
**Tone: Shocked Adult Energy | Mood: Responsible Rage, Served Hot**

---

Your jaw drops somewhere around your bruised collarbone.

You stare at her like she just told you she moonlights as a revolution-starting opera singer.

> "*Hold on.*"  
> "*Hold the FUCK on.*"

You jab a finger toward her so hard you nearly fall off the duck again. Cruller lets out a **"what now?"** quack.

> "You-*princess*-not even an adult yet-*joined a crime syndicate?*"

Your voice hits that octave teachers reserve for **nonsense so stupid it overrides exhaustion.**

> "*A literal warlord's criminal empire?* At-what-*sixteen?!*"

> "The *fuck*, Blue?! That doesn't add up! Who let you do that?! Was there not a *single* adult-guard, advisor, royal babysitter-who thought, â€˜Hey maybe let's NOT send the heir to the throne to play pretend mafia?'"

---

**Vivi** flinches slightly-not out of shame, but sheer surprise.

You're the **first person** in this entire journey to **react like an adult** hearing the plan *after* the adrenaline wears off.

She opens her mouth.

Closes it.

Then, quietly:

> "There wasn't time."

---

She meets your eyes. Serious now.

> "Baroque Works was moving faster than we were. I volunteered before they knew what I was doing."

> "If I hadn't... no one else could have gotten that close. Not without being discovered."

---

She shifts her grip on the reins, her fingers curling tight.

> "And I'm not a child."

A pause.

Then, quieter:

> "Not anymore."

---

That hits differently.

---

You stare at her.

And maybe... you start to see what she meant earlier.

Not a hero.

Not a princess.

> *Just a kid who got tired of watching her home fall apart.*

---

**OOC: This moment is pivotal.**  
You, the "responsible adult," have finally confronted the **full scope of what Vivi did**.  
And she didn't flinch.

You can challenge her more, let it go, or turn that anger toward the people who *should've stopped her*.

What do you say next?

>> USER: No, no fuck that. You're still a kid. The country fucked up. The country is fucked up.

Back in my kingdom, if we were attacked by pirates or something, we'd literally rather jump on their cannonballs rather than let the bad guys get anywhere close to our kids.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Outer Streets - The Teacher's Rage]**  
**Scene: "You Don't Send the Kids"**  
**Tone: Furious Compassion | Mood: Adult Fury, Long Overdue**

---

Your voice cuts through the desert heat like a blade.

> "*No,*" you growl.  
> "*No-fuck that.*"

**Vivi tenses**, surprised again-less by your words this time, and more by the weight behind them.

> "*You're still a kid.* I don't care how many wires you can throw or how noble your speeches are."

> "The country fucked up. The whole damn country is fucked up if it let *you*-*you,* the heir to the throne-run off and join the damn *mafia* to protect it."

You gesture at her-not out of accusation, but with shaking frustration, like a man trying to patch a sinking ship with his bare hands.

> "*Back in my kingdom,* we'd throw ourselves in front of the cannonballs before we let one *child*-any child-take a hit like that."

You spit into the sand.

> "That's what adults are *for.*"

---

Vivi doesn't speak.

She doesn't interrupt.

She just watches you, stunned... and something in her eyes begins to shift.

---

Not hurt.  
Not defensive.  
Not even angry.

But... something that *aches.*

---

She opens her mouth. Then closes it.

Then says, quietly:

> "I didn't have a choice."

---

And you get it.

You *hate* it.

But you **get it.**

---

Behind you, the Straw Hats have grown quiet.  
Even **Luffy** stares, silent for once.  
Tashigi's duck slows beside yours, her hand not even on her sword-eyes forward, listening.

---

Because someone finally said it:

> *This shouldn't have been their fight.*

> *Not the princess. Not the pirates. Not the kids.*

---

And maybe...

Maybe that's why you're still here.

---

**OOC:**  
This is a **turning point**.  
Your role as a mentor, protector, and moral voice has now **cemented** among the party-Vivi especially.

Your words struck a chord not just with her, but with **everyone who heard them.**

Would you like to add anything? Or ride the rest of the way in silence, letting the truth linger in the desert air?

>> USER: And it doesn't matter that you're a princess or not. It just matters because this shouldn't be a child's responsibility.

I palm my baton. I'm going to break the knees of the next member of Alabastan government I see. I don't care if it's a governor, the leader of the royal army, or the king himself. I say coldly

---

The sun blazes above, casting long shadows over the city walls. The desert wind blows warm across your face, but your blood runs cold.

You don't yell this time.

You **don't need to**.

---

> "And it doesn't matter that you're a princess or not."

Your voice is steady. Heavy with truth. Not a whisper. Not a scream. Just the **weight of an adult's fury** made sharp.

> "It just matters because this shouldn't be a child's responsibility."

You reach to your side and **palm your baton**-the familiar shape grounding you, the **Seastone tip still scratched from the last fight**, f</pre>
