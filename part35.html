<pre>into the next vent shaft and start climbing. You're almost out. Go vertical.}

üåÄ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 1 - Look for a familiar corridor, back to the Bananagator racing bar

>> ASSISTANT: **üé≤ Option 1 Selected - "Back to Where It All Began... With a Gator Named Snack Pack."**  
**Tone: Focused Desperation Meets Hopeful Familiarity**  
**üé≤ Navigation Memory Roll - (Eatone +2 Spatial Recall, +1 Citrus Scent Mapping, +1 Educated Guesswork) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**üéØ Outcome: You spot a familiar decorative column, then a broken neon sign... then the scent of fried kebab and overpriced alcohol hits you like a reunion hug. You're on the right path. The **Banana Gator Racing Bar** is just around the bend.**

---

You slow down for just a second-not to breathe, not to rest-

> **To think.**

> "Okay. Neon pillars. Left turn after the water pipe.  
Right before the *terrible mural of Crocodile posing like a playboy centerfold.*"

You scan the hallway-  
There.  
The wall curves just slightly.  
The floor pattern shifts-**tacky carpet** over cold tile.

And then?

> **The gator logo.**  
Worn. Scuffed. But familiar.

You turn-

> And there it is.

The gaudy, ridiculous **Banana Gator Racing Lounge**, somehow untouched by the chaos beneath.  
The fake sand on the floor still shimmers.  
The cocktail lights still blink.  
The **Snack Pack betting board** glows gently behind the bar.

You slow down.  
Limp into the space.  
> "I'm back..."

The bartender-a different one now-looks up.

> "You... uh... want another daiquiri, sir?"

You blink.

> "I think I'll take mine... to go."

**üìù Status Update:**

- You are now in the **casino proper**, at the Banana Gator Racing Lounge  
- No Crocodile in sight. You've **bought yourself space and time**  
- The Straw Hats? Still ahead. But not far  
- Rain Dinners is **fragile** now. The wrong move could still draw attention

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Leave through the front. Walk out like a guest. Bold. Brazen. Maybe it'll work.}  
2. {Cut through the staff corridor behind the bar. You know there's a route to the docks.}  
3. {Ask the bartender if he's seen a group of weirdly dressed people plus one Marine run by.}  
4. {Sit for just thirty seconds. Catch your breath. Then you run.}  
5. {Leave a kiwi-colored calling card on the betting board. Snack Pack would understand.}

üåÄ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 3 - Sorry, did I miss the final race? I knocked a barrel of jungle juice over in my suite when I went to get my coat and spent the last half hour wiping it up. I gesture at my juice, soaked self. 

>> ASSISTANT: **üé≤ Option 3 Selected - "Excuse Me, Sir, Have You Seen Some Extremely Suspicious Guests Come Through Here?"**  
**Tone: Casual, Coated in Juice, Desperate for Intel**  
**üé≤ Deception Roll - (Eatone +2 Improv, +1 Theater Voice, +1 Sticky Visual Evidence) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**üé≤ Bartender's Awareness - (+1 Employee of the Month Energy, -1 Doesn't Get Paid Enough for This) = Result: 2 [Fair]**  
**‚úÖ Outcome: Your lie sails *smoothly*. The bartender buys it-and gives you the exact intel you need. The Straw Hats passed through here **minutes ago**... and they're headed for the docks.**

---

You approach the bar, **dripping citrus**, looking like the result of a keg stand gone wrong and a fruit fight with God.

> "Sorry, did I miss the final race?"

The bartender pauses.

You lean in, pointing at your **soaked, semi-dignified self** with theatrical flair.

> "Knocked over a *barrel* of jungle juice in my suite while reaching for my coat.  
Whole thing went *whoooosh*. I've been cleaning up for half an hour."

The bartender blinks.  
Then slowly sets down the glass he was drying.

> "...That explains the smell."

> "It's *Kiwi forward.* Boutique."

> "Uh-huh."

---

He leans in a bit, lowering his voice as he nods toward the **southwestern service door**.

> "We had a weird group come through like ten minutes ago.  
Kid with a straw hat, tall guy carrying him like luggage. Girl with blue hair. Looked rough."

> "They say where they were going?"

> "Didn't stop to chat, but... pretty sure I heard the blue-haired girl ask someone how to get to the docks.  
Northwest gate. Hidden stair behind the blackjack tables."

He lowers his voice further.

> "Don't tell my boss I told you. I'm technically on *sandstorm lockdown service mode.*"

You grin.

> "Your secret's safe with the pineapple."

> "What?"

> "Nothing."

---

**üìù Info Gained:**

- Straw Hats + Tashigi are en route to the **northwest gate**, using a hidden **stairwell behind the blackjack tables**  
- **You're minutes behind them**-but you're now *on the right route*  
- Casino floor: still bustling. Still dangerous if Crocodile is shadowing through staff corridors

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Head straight for the blackjack tables. Find the hidden stair. You've got a boat to catch.}  
2. {First: swipe a drink from the bar. Citrus deserves a citrus chaser.}  
3. {Blend into the casino crowd. Move slow. Don't draw attention.}  
4. {Ask the bartender one last thing-"You seen a Marine captain? Chain-smoker. Real grumpy."}  
5. {Leave a Beri tip on the counter, then sprint. You're done being subtle.}

üåÄ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 3 - Head towards the main entrance instead. The obvious choice. The unexpectedly obvious choice. Maybe I can circle around and regroup with them.

OOC: crocodile is likely mobilizing his top agents to intercept 

>> ASSISTANT: **üé≤ Option 3 Selected - "Head Toward the Front Door: The Ballsiest Move is the Simplest One."**  
**Tone: Cool-Looking Casual Under Imminent Doom Pressure**  
**üé≤ Misdirection Strategy Roll - (Eatone +2 Unpredictable Thinking, +1 Subtle Swagger, +1 Casino Familiarity) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**üé≤ Baroque Works Interception Roll - (Crocodile +2 Networked Agents, -2 Delay in Deployment, -1 Conflicting Priorities) = Result: 2 [Fair]**  
**‚úÖ Outcome: You stroll right into the lion's den-**and the lion doesn't see you coming.** Crocodile's agents are **fanatically focused** on cutting off the *northwest escape route*. The front? Practically unguarded. For now.

---

You glance toward the blackjack tables...  
Then glance **away.**

> "Nah.  
Let's go through the *front*."

You roll your shoulders.  
Straighten your juice-stained collar.  
Wipe a pulp smear off your cheek with all the grace of a man who just held off apex predators and a warlord with the power of fruit.

> "Let them chase shadows."

You stride through the **casino lounge**, passing tourists cheering at the banana gator betting boards, no one giving you a second glance beyond the smell.

**Security staff?** Distracted.  
**Dealers?** Still calling bets.  
**Patrons?** Drunk and rich and uninterested in your drama.

The **front hall glitters ahead**, framed by towering gold-stone arches and the spinning doors to Rainbase's main plaza.

You pass a pair of **Baroque Works agents**-suited, earpieces, annoyed.

One is muttering into a snail mic:

> "-No, sir, the targets were last seen moving northwest-yes, the stairwell near the blackjack pit.  
No, *not* the guy from the bar. He's gone. Probably a decoy-"

You walk **right past them.**

They don't even blink.

---

**Outside:**

The air is **hot**, but open.  
The crowd is bustling with street vendors, guards, travelers, dock workers.  
And on the far side?

You see the outer market wall-**the docks beyond it.**

You're free.

**And you're now on the *outside* of the trap.**

---

**OOC Tactical Note:**  
Crocodile's agents are now **fully focused on the Straw Hat + Tashigi escape** via the northwest gate.  
You've looped out wide and have the chance to **flank, regroup, or intercept** without resistance-for now.

---

**üìù Status Update:**

- You're outside Rain Dinners.  
- You're ahead of the Straw Hats' likely egress point.  
- You are unpursued and **entirely off Crocodile's radar** for the moment.  
- Time to make your </pre>
