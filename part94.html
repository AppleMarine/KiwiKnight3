<pre> you-ask what you really want.}  
2. {Scene skip - Nightfall. Decision time.}  
3. {A private one-on-one moment-choose Vivi or Tashigi.}

>> USER: Option 1 - As they approach me, they hear me asking a palace aide if Rain Dinners is still solvent as a company, and if I can submit a claim for the lost property in my suite.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Garden Path to Practical Nonsense]**  
**Scene: "The Hero and His Reimbursement Form"**  
**POV: Vivi & Tashigi (Approaching You)**  
**Tone: Classic You | Mood: Absurd, Adored, and Deeply Human**

---

As the last rays of the Alabastan sun streak the sky in honeyed oranges and pinks, the mood around the palace has softened. No more sirens. No more sandstorms. Just the rustle of breeze through date palms, and the chirping of far-off birds relieved to have not been vaporized by a Warlord.

**Vivi and Tashigi step closer**, walking side by side, their conversation slowing as they spot you standing beside a slightly frazzled palace aide with an armful of scrolls.

---

> "...So what I'm saying is, if Rain Dinners *as an establishment* still exists, that would technically mean their insurance policies might still be active. Right?"

You're nodding, your tone entirely reasonable-as though this entire conversation isn't fundamentally insane.

---

> "I had valuables in my suite, you understand. One (1) collapsible Seastone baton, one silk bathrobe *included in the complimentary amenities*, and-uh-three backup shirts, because I was expecting to sweat."

> "A lot."

---

The aide looks like he'd rather face **Crocodile** again than continue this conversation.

---

> "Sir, respectfully, Rain Dinners was-"

> "-a criminal front, I *know,*" you interrupt with a sigh. "But they still advertised a guest services guarantee."

---

**Vivi covers her mouth**, laughing so hard she doubles over for a second.

**Tashigi groans**, hand dragging down her face.

---

> "This is the man who helped save my kingdom."

> "This is the man who blew up a Warlord," Tashigi mutters.

---

You finally glance up from your argument with the aide-and blink as you notice both women standing there.

---

> "Oh. Hey."

> "You two know if there's a legal precedent for recouping vacation damages incurred during an uprising?"

---

**Vivi walks forward**, eyes still sparkling.

> "We were just wondering what you *really* wanted, Sensei."

---

**Tashigi crosses her arms.**

> "Because it looks like you want... a reimbursement for fruit-stained laundry."

---

You blink.

Think.

And with **genuine seriousness**, say:

> "That bathrobe was really soft."

---

A beat.

Then all three of you laugh.

Hard.

---

**OOC:**
They approached you with something serious in mind.

But your ridiculous honesty just reminded them why they care so damn much.

Would you like to:

1. {Have a sincere moment-let them ask what *you* want now.}  
2. {Turn the tables-ask what *they* want next.}  
3. {All laugh it off-no deep talk yet. Just enjoy the moment.}

>> USER: Option 1 - Oh man, I'm going to need to reprogram all the numbers when I get a new den den mushi... What's up, ladies?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Gardens - When the Joke Ends and the Real Talk Starts]**  
**Scene: "So... What's Next?"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Shifted | Mood: Gently Sincere, A Little Raw, Ready**

---

You finish your dramatic sigh and rub your temple like the **bureaucratic headache** of the Grand Line is somehow worse than the cracked ribs you're still healing from.

> "Oh man... I'm going to need to reprogram *all* the numbers when I get a new Den Den Mushi..."

A pause.

> "What's up, ladies?"

You flash them both your usual tired smile-half self-deprecating, half *I'm still standing somehow, please clap*.

---

**Vivi**, still recovering from laughter, steps forward, her smile softening into something deeper.

Not pity.

Not concern.

Just... real.

---

**Tashigi**, standing beside her, folds her arms-not in judgment, but because **this matters to her**, and she wants to seem strong while asking.

---

**Vivi speaks first.**

> "You've done more for us than anyone ever asked you to."

> "More than we had any right to ask."

She looks at you-not with expectation.

But with hope.

> "So now... we want to ask *you.*"

---

**Tashigi's voice follows, calm and low:**

> "What do *you* want, Sensei?"

---

No sarcasm.

No teasing.

Not this time.

> "What comes next-for *you*?"

---

They're giving you that rarest thing in the world:

**A moment to choose.**

---

**OOC: You have the floor. Speak your truth-whether it's heartfelt, hesitant, or hiding behind humor. What does Eatone Cheng want now?**

>> USER: What do I want? Well the people are safe, the kids are safe, you two are safe, I think that's about all I can deserve to ask for. 

Oh, and hope I didn't get fired.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Gardens - The Answer Only You Could Give]**  
**Scene: "What I Want"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Honest | Mood: Quiet, Humble, Undeniably You**

---

The question lingers in the desert air, gentle but immense.

Two women stand across from you-one with a crown and calluses on her heart, the other with a blade and something soft in her gaze-and both have asked the kind of question most people spend their whole lives dodging.

But you?

You don't flinch.

---

You look out over the palace walls, where children are laughing somewhere, down among the recovering city streets.

You exhale.

Then say, simply:

> "What do I want?"

You glance at them both. There's no drama in your voice. No speech. Just clarity.

> "Well... the people are safe."

> "The kids are safe."

You nod toward **Vivi**.

> "You're safe."

Then toward **Tashigi**.

> "You're safe."

---

A shrug, almost sheepish.

> "I think that's about all I can deserve to ask for."

You pause.

A beat.

Then-

> "Oh-also, I hope I didn't get fired."

---

It's not a joke.

Not entirely.

But it earns you the expected reactions.

---

**Vivi** presses a hand to her lips to keep from giggling.

**Tashigi** lets out the kind of sigh that sounds more like surrender than frustration.

---

> "You're impossible," Tashigi mutters.

> "You're kind of perfect," Vivi says, half under her breath.

---

They don't argue with your answer.

Because they know-

**That's who you are.**

The man who never wanted more than the safety of others, a roof over his head, and enough respect to keep his job after taking on a Warlord.

---

But still...

Vivi steps closer.

> "If that's all you feel you *deserve*... maybe it's time we start talking about what you *want,* too."

---

**OOC:**
You've answered humbly. From the heart.

But both women know there's still more behind it.

They're not pushing. Yet.

But the idea is there-planted, waiting.

Would you like the next scene to:

1. {Stay in this moment-speak more sincerely.}
2. {Skip ahead to the night-where offers resurface.}
3. {Walk the palace gardens with one of them-choose.}

>> USER: Option 1 - You two... Looked concerned. Something I can help you with? Probably going to stay a few more days before I head back home. Oh gosh, I think I need to get a new copy of my travel visa...

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Gardens - Humble Heart, Heavy Implications]**  
**Scene: "The Man Who Thinks in Paperwork"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Earnest | Mood: Intimate, Sincere, Almost Too Practical for Emotion**

---

The question you throw back at them-simple, direct-**startles** them more than any dramatic gesture might have.

> "You two... looked concerned."

You adjust your coat absently, your voice calm.

> "Something I can help with?"

> "Probably going to stay a few more days before I head back home."

> "Oh gosh, I think I need to get a new copy of my travel visa..."

---

You trail off, muttering to yourself, already mentally planning a trip to the consulate or maybe that oddly competent scribe's booth by the spice market-

---

But you don't get far.
