<pre>o *chooses to stand when it counts*.**  
- You are mentally and emotionally fit to continue the mission.

---

The tunnel stretches before you now-dim, uncertain, alive with whispered danger.

But not unwatched.  
Not unguarded.  
And **not alone**.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Take point again. Back to work. Carefully guide Tashigi along the flanking path toward Rain Dinners' lower complex.}
2. {Ask one last quiet question-"You ever been this far off-script before?" Just to know you're not the only one.}
3. {Leave a juice message along the wall-*"We went this way"*-in case others come looking for you.}
4. {Draw a map in juice and hang it near the tunnel entrance. If this becomes a grave, at least it'll be *a marked one*.}
5. {"Let's find that princess. And hope she's not dead yet." Move with purpose. It's all about Vivi now.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 1 - Youu're hurt. I'll take point, watch my six.

Also tell me if I'm going the wrong way, you're the one with the map.

Draw my baton and prepare another orb of juice

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected - "You're hurt. I'll take point."**  
**Tone: Steady Resolve | Formation: Frontline Guardian + Injured Officer Backup**  
**🎲 Team Tactics Roll - (Eatone +2 Field Awareness, +1 Respectful Leadership, +1 Juice-and-Baton Combat Readiness) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Tashigi's Trust Roll - (+2 Respect, +1 Tactical Logic, -1 Stubborn Injury) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**✅ Outcome: You assume the lead with Tashigi's full backing. The duo is now officially a coordinated unit. You are the tip of the spear.**

---

> "You're hurt. I'll take point."

Your tone is calm, even-but final. You draw your **Seastone-tipped baton** in a smooth, practiced arc, holding it low and backhanded-**non-lethal but absolute**. With your off-hand, you form another **tight juice orb**, compressed and tuned to **burst or bind** on contact.

Tashigi blinks, then exhales. There's no protest this time. Just a subtle nod as she moves into your **six o'clock position**, sword drawn but held one-handed-*ready*, but not *rushing*.

> "You've got the nose, I've got the layout.  
You walk, I talk. I'll correct you if you're about to charge into an active gator filtration pipe."

> "...How active are we talking?"  
> "Flesh-dissolving foam active."  
> "Copy that."

---

**You step forward.**

The corridor shifts from finished wall to **raw concrete and iron**-**Rain Dinners' bones**, not the painted skin of the guest floors. The lights dim further. **Your juice orb pulses softly**, casting an eerie green halo on the damp walls.

The silence is thicker here. No footsteps but your own. No voices.  
Just the **distant hum of a subterranean system**-like a crocodile snoring behind metal.

---

**Terrain Details:**

- The path branches **twice**. One toward an **elevator shaft**, sealed. The other-a **maintenance ladder** leading down.  
- Tashigi calls it:  
> "Down. Leads toward the sub-basement air tunnels. We can reach the chamber edge without alerting the main guards."

You start to descend.

> *Step. Step. Juice-drip. Breath.*

Somewhere ahead: the **cage**.  
Somewhere inside: **Smoker. The Straw Hats. Vivi.**  
And if you wait too long... **Crocodile himself.**

---

**📝 Current Status:**

- **Eatone**: Frontline position | Baton drawn | Juice orb ready  
- **Tashigi**: Following close, sword half-drawn, navigating from map memory  
- **Party Stealth: Moderate** - No detection yet, but environment is narrowing  
- **Mission Objective:** Reach the *cage chamber* unseen. Intercept. Rescue. Survive.

---

**What would you like to do next at the ladder base?**

1. {Send a thin juice tendril into the vent ahead. Scout for heat, movement, or sound.}
2. {Ask Tashigi if she has a code phrase to give to Smoker if he's conscious when you find him.}
3. {Set a juice trap behind you on the ladder. If you're followed, they'll regret it.}
4. {Peek around the next corner silently. Check for guards or cameras.}
5. {Request that Tashigi draw her blade fully. You're close enough to danger it's no longer optional.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 4 / 5 - Slowly slice the cake around the corner. Motion for Tashigi to ready her blade.

Y'know, your CO runs with a Seastone weapon, right? And also has a devil fruit that makes him produce substance.

I hold up my baton with a dripping hand. Aren't I, like a Beri-store version of him? I joke, hoping to lighten the mood

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 4/5 Hybrid Selected - "Cake Slice + Tactical Banter"**  
**Tone: Quiet Edge + Gallows Humor | Formation: Precision Stealth Entry with Lightened Hearts**  
**🎲 Stealth Action Roll - (Eatone +2 Careful, +1 Baton-Stance, +1 Veteran Hall Monitor Reflexes) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Tashigi's Combat Readiness - (+2 Trained, +1 Banter Response) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**✅ Outcome: You move like a pro. The joke lands. The bond strengthens. No enemies in immediate sight-*yet*.**

---

You hold up one finger.  
**Silent motion: "Wait."**

Then, carefully, **slice the corner** like it's the last piece of Blackbeard's birthday cake and you're making damn sure no one sees you sneak it.

> *One foot forward.  
Baton drawn.  
Juice hand steady.  
No sudden movements.*

As you round the corner, your eyes sweep fast:

- **Steel corridor**, slightly wider now.  
- **Two wall-mounted Den Den cameras**-but *rotating slowly*, with a 4-second blind spot.  
- A **fork** in the path ahead. One route marked *Waste Purge Access*. The other... no signage at all. Just cold air drifting out and the faint sound of **dripping chains.**

Your breath catches. That sound?  
It's **below.**  
Could be the **cage chamber**.

You step back from the edge and motion for Tashigi to draw fully.

She obeys without a word, blade sliding from the scabbard with a clean metallic whisper.

Then-trying to shake the tension just a little-you half-turn and nod to your baton and the sticky droplets still running down your off-hand.

> "Y'know, your CO runs with a Seastone weapon, right?  
Also has a Devil Fruit that lets him produce a substance."

You hold up your baton.

Then your hand.

Then do a weak little jazz-hands shake with both.

> "Aren't I like... a **Beri-store version** of him?"

There's a beat.  
Then a snort from Tashigi.

> "Heh. Only difference is Smoker doesn't have a kill count involving *juice-based concussions.*"

> "Yet."

> "Right. I'll tell him you're his budget twin when we get him out of that cage."

She steps up beside you now-**shoulder to shoulder**. Ready.

---

**📝 Tactical Readout:**

- **Corner cleared**: No enemy patrol in immediate sight  
- **Cameras visible**: Identified rotation timing. Avoidable.  
- **Potential Cage Access Located**: The unmarked path with chain drip sounds likely leads to the Straw Hats  
- **Morale: Steady** - Banter = sanity under pressure

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Time the camera and slip down the unmarked hallway. Head toward the cage quietly.}
2. {Use your juice to blind one of the cameras. Keep your rear safe.}
3. {Ask Tashigi what you'll do *if* the cage is down there-and it's already filling with water.}
4. {Prep a juice-based adhesive trap near the fork-backtrack security.}
5. {Split. One of you hits the purge corridor, the other scouts the cage route. Fast but risky.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 1 - Make silent, tactical hand motions at the cameras and their rotation timing. (Ready to move when you are)

OOC: Tashigi may know about cages, but I don't.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected - "Silent ops. Slide under the cameras. Head for the cage."**  
**Tone: Tactician-in-Training | Action: Coordinated Movement with Nonverbal Team Signals**  
**🎲 Stealth Maneuver Roll - (Eatone +2 Timing, +1 Juice Sense Precision, +1 Tactical Focus) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎲 Tashigi Coordination Roll - (+2 Marine Training, +1 Trust in You) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**✅ Outcome: You both mov</pre>
