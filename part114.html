<pre>owly, clearly torn between admiration and secondhand embarrassment.

> "And now you're fighting Warlords."

You tap your temple.

> "All thanks to Riko-sensei."

> "She once disarmed an armed robber using only a loaded dice set and sheer disappointment."

---

You both laugh again.

It echoes off the walls of the city, under the stars.

---

**You reach the palace steps**, the guards nodding at your approach, familiar now with your face-even if your reputation shifts daily between *hero*, *tourist*, *walking fruit punch*, and *marine-adjacent mop wielder.*

---

Tashigi pauses before heading in.

> "...We can spar."

You blink.

> "Wait, really?"

She looks at you sideways.

> "Tomorrow morning. Training yard. Dawn."

> "I want to see if that yellow belt is real."

---

You flash a grin.

> "Only if you promise not to go full death-blade on me."

She scoffs.

> "No promises."

---

She disappears through the corridor with a rustle of coat and scabbard.

You're left on the steps a moment longer, staring out into the calm of a kingdom you helped save.

---

**OOC:**
Tomorrow morning-**sparring session unlocked**.  
Whether you learn something useful... or just get thoroughly bruised... depends on your choices.

But tonight?

Tonight, you rest.  
Kiwi juice in your blood, kebabs in your belly, and a **very confusing yellow belt legacy** tucked somewhere in your soul.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Head to your room and try to prototype your elemental alarm before sleep.}  
2. {Take a walk through the palace gardens. Perhaps you're not the only one awake.}  
3. {Turn in early. You've got a duel at dawn, Sensei.}

>> USER: ​Option 2 - I wonder how Vivi's day went. Wander around.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Moonlit Gardens]**  
**Scene: "Petals, Promises, and a Princess at Peace"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Gentle | Mood: Serene, Soft Reflection, A Quiet Thread of Intimacy**

---

You peel away from the palace's main hallway, choosing a quieter route-one that winds between moon-drenched stone columns and down into the **palace gardens**, where moonflowers sway open in the night air and the sound of distant fountains whispers like someone telling secrets to the breeze.

**The stone under your feet is warm from the day.**  
The scent of cactus blossoms and imported jasmine lingers just enough to soften your nerves.

---

You let your legs lead you, a mix of idle curiosity and gentle concern curling in your chest.

> *Wonder how she's doing...*

---

You turn a corner-

-and there she is.

---

**Vivi**, seated on a low marble bench beneath the canopy of a **crooked flowering date tree**, her arms wrapped around one knee, the other leg stretched long across the stone.

Her slippers are off, her royal sash discarded beside her. She wears a simple cotton wrap, pale blue and soft like the dusk sky. Her hair is loose, **ruffled by the wind**, and there's a half-eaten fig on the tray beside her, untouched for what looks like a while.

Her eyes are closed. But her brow isn't peaceful.

She's thinking. Deeply.

---

You hesitate at the edge of the garden path.

She senses you anyway.

> "Couldn't sleep either?" she asks softly, eyes still closed.

---

You shuffle forward, boots quieter than they've ever been in your life.

> "I was wondering how your day went."

A small, tired smile curls at her lips. She opens one eye, then the other. Her voice is barely above the rustling leaves.

> "Busy."

A pause.

> "Everyone wants something. A treaty signed. A road repaved. A sibling found. A father reassured."

Another pause.

> "Some people just want me to still be the girl I was before."

She opens her eyes fully now.

> "That girl doesn't exist anymore."

---

You lower yourself onto the far end of the bench. Not too close. But close enough.

> "I think she's still in there," you say, after a beat. "She just has... better armor now."

Vivi lets out a quiet, shaky laugh.

> "I think she traded the armor for war paint."

---

The garden falls into a silence again.

But it's different from before.  
Not sad. Not strained.  
Just... two people **sharing a pause**, under stars they both nearly didn't live to see.

---

> "You staying?" she asks, not looking at you this time.

You blink.

> "In the palace?"

> "In Alabasta."

You don't answer right away.

So she glances at you, head tilted slightly, as if to say:

**‘I won't push. But I need to know.'**

---

Would you like to:

1. {Be honest. You still don't know-but part of you wants to.}  
2. {Say yes. Say you're staying-at least for a while.}  
3. {Answer with a question: "Do you want me to?"}

>> USER: Option 2 - Yeah, I was going to stay, at least until reconstruction in Alubarna is complete. (Clueless) Make sure no roofs fall on you when you're walking the town, you know 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Gardens - Under the Date Tree]**  
**Scene: "Anchored in Citrus and Stone"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Soft | Mood: Deepening Connection, Gentle Relief**

---

You scratch the back of your neck, eyes drifting toward the moonlit trellises and the vines hanging from the old stonework like memories yet to be sorted.

> "Yeah," you say, casual. Honest. Like it's the simplest truth in the world.  
> "I was going to stay."

You glance toward her, a shrug pulling at one shoulder.

> "At least until reconstruction in Alubarna's done. Got to make sure no roofs fall on you when you're walking through town, y'know."

You add a slight grin at the end, trying to keep the tone light. Clueless to the weight of your words.

But **Vivi doesn't laugh**.

Not right away.

She just... looks at you. Really looks.

---

Her eyes aren't watery.  
They're **clear**.  
Steady.

But there's something in the way her hands curl lightly in her lap-  
The way her shoulders lower-  
The way her chest lifts with the first **real exhale** she's probably taken all day.

---

> "You always say things like that," she says.

Her voice is soft.

> "Like they're nothing."

---

You blink.

> "Like what?"

She turns her head toward you, moonlight pooling in her hair like a second crown.

> "Like you don't realize how rare it is to hear them."

---

There's a quiet moment.

A cool breeze pushes through the trees.

Somewhere nearby, a guard yawns.  
A fox stirs near the garden wall.

But here-under this crooked date tree-it's just you two.

---

She smiles.

Genuinely.

> "Thank you."

A pause.

Then, with more playfulness than before:

> "Though if a roof does fall on me, I'm holding you personally accountable."

You hold up a hand.

> "Fair. I'll file an apology form with the Marine Civil Engineering Department. Might take a year."

---

The quiet laughter shared now is easier.  
No longer defensive.  
No longer tired.  
Just... soft. Real.

---

**OOC: You've gained another layer to your bond with Vivi -**  
**"A Rooftop Promise: An Anchor in Rebuilding"**

Where others may come and go with victory banners or headlines,  
**you stayed.**

And **she noticed.**

---

Would you like to:

1. {Ask her how she's really feeling-about the future, the war, her place in it all.}  
2. {Tell her goodnight, and return to your room to prepare for your dawn spar.}  
3. {Say nothing else. Just sit beside her, until the moon begins to dip.}

>> USER: Option 3 - Once it gets late enough, get up and pat her head.

Don't stay up too late, blue. You're still in your growing years, unlike me.

Head towards my room for a well deserved bath and rest.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Garden Departure]**  
**Scene: "A Pat, a Parting, and a Promise in Passing"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Tender | Mood: Contentment, Quiet Caring, A Soft Night Close**

---

The minutes stretch in peaceful silence. The kind of silence only people who've suffered together-and chosen to heal-can share. The moon arcs gently overhead, brushing the rooftops with silver. You don't say a word, and neither does she.

You sit beside her until the garden begins to yawn with the earliest signs of deep nig</pre>
