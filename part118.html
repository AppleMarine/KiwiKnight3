<pre>*[Alubarna Palace - Corridor to the Breakfast Hall]**  
**Scene: "Letters, Laughter, and a Lap of Fame"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Wholesome | Mood: Light, Heartfelt, Connected**

---

Your legs are still twitching with phantom pain from the Tashigi Special (™), but at least you're upright and on your way to breakfast-with two of the strongest-willed women you've ever met flanking you like bodyguards who just so happen to also sass you into humility.

You rummage through your coat and pull out the **letters**, thumbing the edges thoughtfully.

> "Hey," you say, holding them up. "Wanna see something funny?"

Tashigi looks over, mildly suspicious.

Vivi glances back with curiosity already blooming in her expression.

---

You hold up the first-**Principal Okada's Letter**.

> "This one's from my school. They think I'm on... *extended leave.*"

You clear your throat.

> "Quote: ‘Please confirm you are, in fact, still alive.'"

Tashigi nearly snorts her tea. Vivi chokes down a laugh behind a hand.

---

You tap the second letter, then hand it over to Vivi with exaggerated care.

> "This one's from a student. Kid named Masato. Very serious. Very academic."

They both lean in, reading the crayon-scrawled message:

> _"Sensei! Are you a pirate now?? Did you beat up Crocodile??"_

And then the drawing.  
Of you.  
Holding a sword the size of the palace tower.  
Riding a poorly drawn gator with a mustache and labeled "Snackpak."

---

Vivi bursts into laughter, clutching the drawing.

> "You *have* to frame this!"

Tashigi leans over her shoulder.

> "It's disturbingly accurate."

> "I never wore that many belts," you mutter.

---

And finally-the **tabloid clipping**.

You flash it with mock pride:

> **"The Kiwi Knight of Alabasta!"**  
> "Hero of the People or Just Mildly Sticky Menace?"

Vivi covers her mouth, shoulders shaking.  
Tashigi flat-out laughs, her usually reserved demeanor cracking like a dropped teacup.

---

> "Mildly sticky menace," she repeats under her breath.

> "That's going on your gravestone," Vivi adds.

---

You grin as you tuck the letters back into your coat.

> "Y'know... I was worried they'd just move on without me. But it's kind of nice, knowing someone out there's still paying attention. Even if it's just a student with wild artistic delusions."

---

Tashigi's smile softens.

> "They're proud. That much is clear."

Vivi nods, eyes thoughtful.

> "It means they still see the teacher. Even after everything."

---

You pause, that weight settling in your chest again.  
Not heavy. Just... **real**.

---

You walk on together, laughter lingering like perfume in the corridor.  
And for the first time in a while, the path ahead feels a little less uncertain.

---

**OOC: Your bond with both Vivi and Tashigi has deepened through shared vulnerability and laughter.**  
**They see not just the man who stood beside them-but the one who still belongs to the world beyond war.**

---

Would you like to:

1. {Join them for breakfast. See if Cobra or Smoker drops in.}  
2. {Sit with Vivi privately, maybe share more from your life.}  
3. {Offer to train a new palace guard recruit team with Tashigi today.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - Head to the dining hall. I'll drop my response letters at the post office later

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Royal Dining Hall, Morning of Day 3]**  
**Scene: "Breakfast of Survivors"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Comforting | Mood: Familiar, Light-Bonded Banter**

---

The palace doors part as the three of you enter together, and you're hit with the warm aroma of **spiced eggs, grilled cactus blossoms, and fresh flatbreads** stacked high beside bowls of minty yogurt and sweet melon slices.

You half expect trumpets and a scroll announcing *"Now Entering: The Sticky Defender of the People"*-but thankfully, **no fanfare.** Just the **clink of cutlery**, the **low murmur of guards and aides**, and the gentle hum of **a kingdom trying to return to normal**.

---

**King Cobra** is already seated, robe loosely tied, sipping something thick and caffeinated.  
He raises an eyebrow as your trio enters.

> "Good morning," he rumbles. "I see the morning spar didn't kill you."

You salute lazily.

> "The secret is to collapse early and often. Builds morale."

---

Tashigi smirks. Vivi rolls her eyes, already moving to take her usual spot at her father's right.

You... awkwardly hover.

Until Cobra gestures to the seat across from him.

> "Sit. Before I assign you as the royal mop again."

---

You oblige.

---

**Moments later, Smoker arrives**, trailing a mild cloud of steam behind him, a large scar freshly bandaged near his left temple. He gives you a long, flat look.

> "Still alive, huh?"

> "Define ‘alive,'" you reply, through a mouthful of grilled onion.

He grunts. Takes the seat next to Tashigi.

---

For a while, **breakfast proceeds like a quiet little miracle**:

- **Smoker and Cobra** discuss **marine coordination and civil rebuilds**, though Smoker continues trying to correct the tabloids about his "solo heroism."
- **Tashigi keeps glancing at you** like she might ask for a rematch at any moment.
- **Vivi passes you a bowl of fruit**, pointedly sliding the kiwi slices to your side.
- You share a few more **letters** for their amusement, including one from the school cafeteria lady who threatens to pickle your kneecaps if you don't return her missing ladle.

---

And somewhere in between mouthfuls and mirth-

You feel it.

That **thread of belonging**.  
A subtle, warm undercurrent.

You're not just a tourist anymore.  
Not just a "sticky menace."  
You're **a thread in the tapestry** now.

---

**OOC: Scene Concludes**  
You've gained:

- **+5 Relationship (All):** Shared meal, comfort, humor.  
- **+1 Reputation (Palace Staff):** Known as "That Guy Who Fought a Warlord and Eats a Lot of Melon."  
- **Inventory Note:** You still have your response letters, tucked in coat. Ready to mail post-breakfast.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Speak privately with Cobra after breakfast about more permanent residency.}  
2. {Return to town with Tashigi to continue patrols.}  
3. {Spend some of the morning with Vivi before the next wave of royal duties takes her.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - I really want to confirm my residency status, and make sure I'm registered in the tax system. Also that if I have an official job title or a salary (to pay taxes on). I don't want to be a mooch forever, after all.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Cobra's Study, Midmorning]**  
**Scene: "Papers, Position, and Paying It Forward"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Responsible | Mood: Sincere, Light Bureaucratic Comedy**

---

Breakfast ends on a warm note-plates cleared, laughter shared, guards trying not to openly giggle at Vivi's dramatic reading of your school cafeteria lady's ladle ultimatum.

But you've got things to handle.

**Grown-up things.**

---

You quietly pull **King Cobra** aside just as he's rising from his chair, still loosening the belt of his robe like a man who longs for the sweet embrace of a post-breakfast nap.

> "Your Majesty, I was hoping we could... talk briefly? Something I've been meaning to get squared away."

---

He gives you a long, side-eyed glance.

> "Is this about the baton thing again?"

> "No, no, we're good on the kneecap front."

> "Good," he says dryly. "They still ache."

---

**Moments later-**  
You're in **Cobra's study**, a comfortably dusty room of dark wood and old tomes, the **air perfumed with ink, desert parchment, and sun-baked nostalgia.**

He gestures toward a long desk with various forms already laid out-he may be a king, but he clearly also doubles as the Kingdom's HR department when necessary.

You awkwardly clear your throat.

---

> "So... I'm staying. At least for a while. Maybe longer."

Cobra leans on the desk, lacing his fingers.

> "Good."

You blink.

> "Wait, that's it?"

> "You saved my daughter's life, my country's capital, and quite possibly a few future monarchs that haven't even been</pre>
