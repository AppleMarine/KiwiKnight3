<pre>alm, calm and alert, like a watchdog made of pulp and purpose.

---

Then... you hear it.

**The air changes.**

A door far below **hisses open**-somewhere behind the cage chamber.  
A voice follows. **Calm. Cool. Dangerous.**

> "I warned you, Princess.  
Alabasta will be saved-*with or without you.*"

You know that voice. You saw the headlines.  
**Sir Crocodile.**  
Warlord. Coup leader. Absolute bastard with a hook for a hand and no patience for resistance.

You and Tashigi lock eyes.

> *It's go time. But not strike time. Not yet.*

---

**📝 Update:**

- Crocodile has arrived. He is now monologuing in the chamber below.  
- You and Tashigi are in *perfect stealth position* for recon or a surgical strike if needed.  
- The Straw Hats remain caged. Vivi visibly flinched at Crocodile's voice.  
- Tashigi is *laser-focused*. Not moving. Waiting for a window.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Observe in silence. Let Crocodile reveal more. Every villain monologue is intel gold.}
2. {Whisper a juice-thread down toward the cage. Try to tap the bars to alert them *without alerting Crocodile.*}
3. {Ask Tashigi: "If he drops that cage... is there anything we can do?" Just in case.}
4. {Begin forming a juice construct across the ceiling-*if you need to drop in fast*, you'll have a path.}
5. {Pull back slightly. Prep for ranged support. You're a striker, not a savior. Know your role.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 1 - My eyes widen at the sight of crocodile - guess he really is behind all this.  I gently pat Tashigi's sword arm and shake my head. There is no way I'm fighting a warlord. And there's no way I'm letting you throw yourself at him.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected - "Observe. Confirm. *Do Not Engage.*"**  
**Tone: Controlled Fear + Protective Instinct | Decision: Recon over Heroics**  
**🎲 Willpower vs. Intimidation Roll - (Eatone +2 Discipline, +1 Moral Focus, -1 Crocodile Terror Aura) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**🎲 Tashigi's Instinct to Act Roll - (+2 Duty, +1 Wound Fatigue, -2 You Stopping Her) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**✅ Outcome: You hold your ground-emotionally and physically. Tashigi pauses. You both stay hidden... and what you see may change everything.**

---

Your **eyes go wide** as **Crocodile** steps into view below.  
There's no mistaking him:

- Broad-shouldered, tan skin, gold hook glinting in the underground light.  
- Fur-collared coat, Warlord swagger, cigar already lit like the *credits are about to roll*.  
- His presence hits like **a vice on your chest**-the weight of a man who's destroyed kingdoms and smiled through it.

Your first instinct?  
**Nope.**

You gently reach out and pat Tashigi's arm-right near the **guard of her blade**, fingers firm but calm. Then shake your head, ever so slightly.

> "There is *no way* I'm fighting a Warlord."

You nod toward her blade.

> "And there's no way I'm letting *you* throw yourself at him. Not like this."

She grits her teeth-but doesn't move.

You see the fire in her eyes, the clenched jaw. But also the way her **knees wobble for just a second**.  
She exhales.  
And stays put.

> "...You're right," she whispers. "He'd kill us both."

---

Below, **Crocodile paces** in front of the cage, hands behind his back like a man delivering a guest lecture at *Murder College.*

> "You know, I admired your loyalty, Princess. Truly.  
But this kingdom? These people? They've been broken for years.  
What I'm doing... is mercy."

Vivi shouts something in response. You can't make out the words, but her voice **cracks with fury.**

Crocodile raises his hook.

> "You'll all serve a purpose. One final message to the rebels above."

He turns to a **large lever** at the back wall.  
**Your heart skips a beat.**

Tashigi whispers:

> "That's the drop release. He's going to kill them."

---

**📝 Situation Update:**

- Crocodile has begun **monologuing to the cage**-confirmed villain behavior.  
- The **release lever is in view.** If he pulls it, the cage will fall into the Banana Gator pit.  
- Tashigi is *restrained but tense*-ready to break cover if you give her the word.  
- You are both **still unseen.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Whisper: "Do we have a shot at that lever?" Try to disable it with juice.}
2. {Send a juice tendril down to Vivi or Nami. Let them know you're here-but subtle.}
3. {Start preparing a juice construct across the ceiling. You *might* be able to get above the cage fast.}
4. {Wait. Just a little longer. He may still gloat. The more he talks, the more you learn.}
5. {Look for other exits. If the cage falls... someone has to live to tell the story.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 5 - That cage... Maybe it's not an immediate drop? He seems like the kind of fellow to let his victims have time to ponder their doom.

I grin weakly.

Watch Crocodile "talk" any remaining hope out of Vivi 

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 5 Selected - "Maybe he wants them to *simmer* first."**  
**Tone: Grim Observation with a Weak Smile | Action: Recon Continued, Morbid Humor Engaged**  
**🎲 Insight Roll - (Eatone +2 Psychological Read, +1 Villain Trope Recognition) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Tashigi's Emotional Control - (+1 Anger, +1 Duty, -1 Wounded) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**✅ Outcome: Your prediction is correct-Crocodile *isn't* dropping the cage yet. He's playing with them. Watching breaks your heart... but gives you precious time.**

---

You hold your position, fingers trembling just slightly on your baton.  
Then you mutter, voice dry:

> "That cage... it's not an instant drop, is it?  
He's the kind of guy who'd give his victims time to *ponder their doom.*"

You flash a **weak grin**, more exhale than joke.  
Tashigi doesn't laugh-but her eyes flicker with grim understanding.

> "Yeah. He's a sadist, not a sniper."

Below, **Crocodile stands now with his back to the cage**, the massive lever still untouched.  
He paces slowly, hand brushing along a **railing** as he speaks. His voice is soft-but in this echoing cavern, it **booms**.

> "You thought friendship would save you."  
> "You thought a kingdom's pain could be mended by kindness."  
> "You even brought children into this. A little reindeer. A child doctor. A pirate with the brain of a sea sponge."

He turns and steps closer to the cage, raising his hook, **pointing directly at Vivi**.

> "*This is what your hope bought you, princess.*  
Not salvation. Not peace.  
A box. A pit. And teeth."

Vivi stares back through the bars, shaking-but not backing away.  
Her mouth moves. You can't hear the words-but **you recognize defiance**.

Crocodile chuckles.

> "No clever speech?"  
> "No dramatic plea? I'd hoped for something more... poetic."

He takes a **cigar from his coat**, lights it with a tiny flash of sand-generated heat.

Then?

He **sits.**  
Right on the control platform.

> "We'll wait, then.  
Let your fear catch up."

---

**📝 Situation Update:**

- Crocodile is **not pulling the lever yet.**  
- He is **psychologically tormenting** them-especially Vivi.  
- The Straw Hats seem groggy or incapacitated, likely from earlier fights.  
- **You now have time.** Not much, but **time.**

Tashigi glances at you, whispering:

> "That's our window.  
If we're doing something... we do it now."

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Start forming a juice thread down to Vivi. Subtle. Whisper your presence. Let her help.}  
2. {Create a juice noose or clamp near the lever-prepare to stop it if pulled.}  
3. {Form a juice walkway across the ceiling. One of you drops above the cage, the other covers.}  
4. {Split up. You flank left, she flanks right. Someone needs to get to the lever.}  
5. {Whisper to Tashigi: "We disable him, *then* get the cage. He's the threat." Plan an ambush.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 2 - Maybe... Maybe I can use my fruit ability - Kiwi juice, if you haven't smelled it already, to try to make a tendril and jam the lever. No guarantees that its go</pre>
