<pre>d by both the Crown and former rebel leaders. Your name and headband say you're registered. Your voice says you don't remember that."

She doesn't shout.

She speaks like **a sword in a sheath**-sharp enough to be felt, but never waved around carelessly.

> "So which is it, soldier? Are you here to feed your people-"

She steps closer.

> "-or light another fire?"

---

You feel it.

That subtle *cooling* of the air.

Not from intimidation, but from something more dangerous-

**Moral clarity.**

**Unshakable direction.**

---

The rebel clenches his jaw.

Not cowed. Not scared.

Just... ***cornered by logic.***

He breathes in.

Holds it.

Then finally mutters:

> "...Just wanted to make sure we weren't last in line. Again."

---

Tashigi nods once, no smugness.

> "Then next time, speak to the coordinators. Not the guards."

> "You'll keep more friends that way."

---

The crowd disperses slowly.  
The rebel nods stiffly.  
The guard exhales like he just dodged a duel.

---

Tashigi turns back toward you.  
Her stance relaxes by half a degree.

She raises an eyebrow.

> "What? No commentary? No ‘juice-based motivational speech'?"

---

You offer a wry smile.

> "I'm taking notes. Trying to figure out if that clipboard is the actual source of your power."

---

She rolls her eyes but doesn't deny it.

---

**OOC: You've learned something about her:**

- **Tashigi doesn't just lead with her blade.**  
She understands people. She listens. She *pushes without humiliating*.  
There's a strength in her restraint that no Marine Academy ever taught.

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Ask her about where she learned that style-maybe it wasn't just Marine training.}  
2. {Comment about how much this kingdom still has left to heal.}  
3. {Walk beside her and change the subject-something lighter. Let the silence bond.}

>> USER: Option 1 - Sorry. Policing isn't my strong suit. My experience is limited to stopping kids from stealing each other's lunches. Well frankly, everything that's happened so far isn't my strong suit either.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - After the Crowd, Walking the Streets]**  
**Scene: "The Weight of Justice"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Casual, Self-Reflective, A Little Vulnerable**

---

You walk beside **Tashigi**, your footsteps falling into the rhythm of the city.

A city that's still finding its breath.

The streets are quieter now, but you can feel the remnants of tension stirring beneath the surface-faint murmurs from civilians still reeling from the war. A young rebel muttering to himself in the alley. A vendor still counting the marks on his coin.

---

Tashigi shoots you a glance, her expression unreadable. She knows you're holding back something. It's the same way you notice the tightness in her shoulders whenever a question she doesn't have an answer to hangs in the air.

She stays quiet for a moment, letting the natural pause of the street fill in the space between you two. But then, without warning:

> "You're not *just* a teacher."

---

The comment's so simple. So unassuming. But it holds weight in the air.

> "You've been out there, Cheng. You've seen what people can do when they stop thinking and start *fighting* for something."

Her tone softens as she keeps her eyes forward, scanning for the next signs of conflict or unrest.

> "I saw it when you defended me. You didn't hesitate. You just... *did*."

---

You glance at her.

**Tashigi**. The Marine. The swordswoman.  
And here she is, looking at you like you *belong here.* Like your instincts mattered. Like your choices made sense.

---

> "I'll admit... I'm not exactly in the Marine Academy's *ideal* class of conduct either."

Her voice is light, but her smile barely shows.

> "I was just like you when I started. Overwhelmed by the sheer *chaos* of it all. But..."

Her voice trails off for a moment.

> "...I've learned that policing isn't just about giving orders or being a ‘perfect soldier.' It's about *listening*. And finding the next step. Even when you feel like you're falling behind."

She glances over at you with that rare soft look.

> "You're doing your part. I think you've already helped more people than you realize."

---

You stop for a moment, processing what she's said. She's right. No one asked you to be a Marine.  
No one expected you to have a *real* role.

But you *chose* this path. You chose to stay. And now?

Maybe it's not about being *perfect*. Maybe it's about **being present**.

---

You finally chuckle, rubbing the back of your neck in a way that seems more **sore** than nervous.

> "Yeah, guess I'm still figuring out how to ‘police' without thinking too hard about the ‘rules.'"

---

She smirks at that.

> "As long as you keep thinking. Even when you want to stop."

> "That's the difference between someone who leads *and* someone who gets led."

---

You walk side-by-side again, the sound of distant children's laughter filtering into the air.

You might not be the "perfect" figure of authority in this kingdom.

But maybe-just maybe-you're *what it needs.*

---

**OOC:**
Tashigi's words have found a place within you.  
You've learned a lot in a short time.  
Now, **what's next?**

Would you like to:

1. {Talk to Tashigi about your role moving forward-what's really expected of you?}  
2. {Go back to the palace to check in with Vivi about her next steps in rebuilding Alabasta?}  
3. {Scout a new area of Alubarna and continue your patrol.}

>> USER: Option 3 - I wonder if I could use a Kiwi Elemental to patrol for me. I really haven't had time to explore this new move of mine. I'd probably get complaints about it leaving a snail trail everywhere, though

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Midday Streets, Further into the City]**  
**Scene: "Juice Patrol"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Light | Mood: Curious, Experimental, A Touch of Chaos**

---

The city shifts as you and Tashigi move into the next district-a neighborhood closer to the water, where the smells of spice markets, sea-salt, and scorched wood from past fires all mix into something uniquely Alabastan.

Children run through alleyways with sticks shaped like swords.  
Vendors call for attention, holding up hand-stitched bags and cactus-blossom perfumes.  
The buildings are a little lower here, more communal. More open. More lived in.

---

As you walk, you absently flick your fingers, conjuring a few droplets of **green-gold kiwi juice**, testing the weight and viscosity.

**Thicker than usual. Sweeter.**

Probably influenced by your mood.  
Or the residual lunch sugar from that mango candy earlier.  
Hard to say.

---

> "Y'know..." you mutter aloud, turning the juice in your palm thoughtfully, "I've been thinking."

**Tashigi**, ahead of you, doesn't stop walking.

> "This usually ends in disaster or juice."

You ignore her-gracefully, of course.

> "What if I could make a kiwi elemental patrol *for* me?"

You gesture vaguely at the rooftops.

> "Like a big citrusy watchdog. Rumbles through alleys. Keeps watch on dark corners. Maybe even hands out juice boxes to kids."

---

**Tashigi stops.**  
Turns.  
Stares at you.

> "You're serious."

---

You are.

Well. Mostly.

You look down at your hand, concentrate a little harder... and from your palm, **a wet *bloop*** sound echoes outward.

A small **kiwi-shaped blob** emerges, one stubby arm, a half-face, and two googly juice eyes forming lazily. It stares at you. Then at Tashigi.

Then **wobbles upright**, looking determined.

---

You give it a pat.

> "There. Prototype Mk. I."

> "Kiwi-Kop."

---

Tashigi squints at it.

> "...You *named* it?"

> "It doesn't even have legs."

> "It's *leaking.*"

---

Sure enough, **Kiwi-Kop** begins slowly seeping into the cobblestones as it waddles toward a confused fruit vendor, leaving a faintly green trail behind it like a toddler after a popsicle bath.

The vendor blinks.

> "...Is that supposed to be... helpful?"

---

You raise your arms dramatically.

> "It's *revolutionary civic engage</pre>
