<pre>les and knees of those nearby.*
- *As it spreads, you feel movement through the mist. Vibrations. Shifts. Footsteps. Sweeps of weapons.*
- *You gain enhanced localized awareness within a ~15 ft radius.*

You breathe deep.

> That's Zoro, moving forward.  
> That's Tashigi's foot sliding wide-**she's flanking left.**  
> That's Luffy leaping-he's gonna break right.

And behind you?

> Vivi. Steady.  
Not fleeing. Not panicking.  
Just trusting.

Across the river:

**Mr. 2 Bon Clay** finishes his twirl and flings one long leg out like a ballerina with vengeance issues.

> "So you've come to dance with Baroque Works at the *River of Rebellion*! Shall we begin the opening act?!"

A **snap of fingers**.  
Agents charge.

You don't move.

> You're the wall.  
> You're the mist.  
> You're the **goddamn substitute teacher who stayed late on a war day.**

---

**OOC Summary:**

- Vivi is behind you and under your protection.  
- Kiwi mist is active, giving you early warning of close-range threats.  
- You've taken the defensive/support position, allowing the Straw Hats to hit first.

---

**Incoming combat scenario.**

First enemy-**Baroque Works footsoldier**-approaching fast. Low, fast runner. Knife drawn. You feel him hit the edge of your mist field.

**What do you do?**

1. {Juice-thicken the mist directly beneath his feet-trip him. Classic slapstick takedown.}  
2. {Baton out, intercept him with a precise, non-lethal Seastone jab. You're still professional.}  
3. {Let him pass-your priority is Vivi. Strike only if he closes.}  
4. {Blast a stream of sour juice straight into his face from behind the mist. Ocular warfare.}  
5. {Redirect the mist-make it swirl around *another* target. You're hunting someone bigger.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 2 - Give him the good ol' one two. Yell at Bon Clay. Hey! You're the guy from earlier! You're one of Crocodile's bastards?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - Mist & Motion | Combat Begins]**  
**Tone: Sharp and Tactical | Mood: Teacher Mode: Unleashed**  
**ðŸŽ² Combat Roll - (Eatone +2 Baton Technique, +1 Mist Awareness, +1 Initiative Read) = Result: 8 [Legendary]**  
**ðŸŽ¯ Outcome: You intercept the attacker *before he even sees you*, land a **precision baton strike to the temple**, and drop him flat in the sand-**consciousness optional**.**

---

The first footfall enters your mist field-**you feel it** more than see it.

A shift in pressure.  
A ripple in the juice.  
A weight *right where it shouldn't be.*

Your baton **snaps out** from your side in a perfect arc, Seastone tip glinting just once as it extends *mid-motion*.

> *CRACK!*

You don't even need to look.

The Baroque agent crumples mid-step, flipping heel over head and landing with a soft *whump* in the sand beside the skiff.  
Out cold.  
Not dead.  
**Efficient. Clean. Professional.**

---

Then you raise your voice, eyes now locked on the **dancing silhouette** on the far riverbank.

> "HEY! You're that guy from earlier!"

**Mr. 2 Bon Clay**, mid spin, freezes mid-dramatic pirouette.

He squints.

> "The *pineapple-looking one* from the bar?!"

You point your baton squarely at him.

> "You're *one of Crocodile's bastards*?"

A sharp gasp escapes him.  
He dramatically recoils, hand on chest.

> "*BASTARD?!*  
How *dare* you! I am **Mr. 2 Bon Clay**, Queen of the Kick Line, Assassin Extraordinaire, and possibly the **most expressive** man on this battlefield!"

A pause.

Then he straightens, fans fluttering.

> "But yes. Also that."

---

Around you, battle breaks:

- **Zoro** meets two agents in a whirlwind of steel.  
- **Tashigi** is already locked with a large hammer-wielding brute-swords clashing in hot, dry arcs.  
- **Nami** has begun her weather pattern build-up.  
- **Luffy**, now fully awake, lets out a rubbery *crack* as he rockets toward the river's edge.  
- **Chopper** has transformed-**Guard Point.** He's shielding **Usopp**, who is behind a crate building something that **definitely explodes.**

And you?

Still in front of **Vivi**.  
Still calm.  
Mist curling around your legs like a loyal animal.

---

**Bon Clay's eyes lock onto you.**

> "Oh ho~ You want to dance *with me*?! Come then, JUICE-MAN! I shall show you the footwork of DEATH~!"

He leaps-**straight toward your position.**

---

**OOC:**  
Bon Clay is coming in fast. His fighting style involves **taijutsu**, high kicks, and **Clone-Clone Fruit transformation**-which you are **not aware of yet**.

**He's targeting you now.**

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Mist surge-blind his approach, thicken the air, then *crack him mid-spin*.}  
2. {Baton up-pure melee. Let's see if dance-fu beats substitute teacher smackdown.}  
3. {Hold him off, lure him into the mist deeper. You'll counter when he loses his footing.}  
4. {Warn Vivi-"If he gets through, *run*. I'll catch up."}  
5. {Switch tactics. Spray a wide acidic burst midair to throw off his rhythm and force a crash landing.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Oh shit! Why me?! 

I call out! Oi! Need some help here, got a priority baddy on me!

Option 4 / 5 - Will a more acidic spray at Bon Clay. It seems to be greener than usual. Odd.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora Skirmish - Dance vs. Juice]**  
**Tone: Rising Panic, Improvised Precision | Mood: Dancer Meets Deluge**  
**ðŸŽ² Acidic Spray Roll - (Eatone +2 Fruit Power, +1 Desperation, +1 Focused Aim) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ðŸŽ² Bon Clay Evasion Roll - (+2 Acrobatics, -1 Overconfidence, -1 Unfamiliarity with Fruit) = Result: 2 [Fair]**  
**âœ… Outcome: Bon Clay eats a faceful of *acid-green citrus spray*, is **blinded mid-leap**, and crashes *spectacularly* into the sand-twirling, flailing, shrieking. You've *partially neutralized* a major threat. For now.**

---

> "*OH SHIT! WHY ME?!*"

You skid back half a step, eyes wide as Bon Clay launches like a **screaming glitter missile of ballet-fueled murder**, foot extended high and fan fluttering like a death flag.

> "Oi! Need some help here! Got a *priority baddy* on me!"

You don't wait for an answer.  
Instead, you yank your arm forward, palm up, and **will it.**

> *PFTSSSSHHHHH-!*

A pressurized jet of kiwi juice-**sharper, more acidic**, and **noticeably greener** than anything you've produced before-bursts from your palm in a twisting arc.

It *hisses* in the air like a venomous vine.

Bon Clay sees it too late.

> "-My eyes! MY FABULOUS EYES-*AGH!*"

His leap turns into a **pirouetting crash**, body flailing sideways into the sand like a sabotaged stage prop.

He hits the ground spinning and screaming, tumbling into one of his own agents.

> "*I'm blind with flavor!!*"

---

You blink, staring at the trail of juice still steaming in the air.

It's **thicker** than your usual spray.  
And more **acidic**-clearly by your will, but... *sharper than expected*.  
Almost **vibrant**, like your power's *listening harder* now.

> *That's new.*

Vivi, behind you, leans around with wide eyes.

> "Was that-supposed to be *that* strong?"

You don't even answer. You're too busy watching Bon Clay flail, trying to regain dignity in a puddle of sand and kiwi.

---

From the side, **Zoro** snorts.

> "Nice shot, pineapple."

---

**Bon Clay is not defeated, but temporarily disabled.**  
He'll recover soon-but now he knows **you're dangerous.**  
The battlefield shifts in your favor.

---

**OOC:**
- New evolution unlocked: **Acid Control** - With intent, Eatone can vary the *acidic potency* of his juice attacks.  
- Strength, color, and flavor now respond more dynamically to emotion and need.  
- Bon Clay has been neutralized long enough to shift focus or reposition.

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Press the advantage-go in with baton and finish the fight before he recovers.}  
2. {Help another crew member while Bon Clay's down. Spread the support.}  
3. {Turn to Vivi. "Still good back there?" Reaffirm your guard role.}  
4. {Ask Tashigi-"Wanna help me *curbstomp a ballerina?*"}  
5. {Observe Bon Clay closely. That face-ch</pre>
