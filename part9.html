<pre> watching internal Rain Dinners operations. He is not here officially.
- **Marine surveillance equipment** is active. This may be Smoker's own black-ops job.
- You are likely the only civilian who's seen him so far.
- The Daiquiri is... **phenomenal.**

---

**Inventory Update:**
- 🥃 One Daiquiri - Cold, minty, no toxins detected  
- 🎖 Status: "Cheng, Guest of Room 703" (Still intact)  
- 🧠 Mental Map: Rain Dinners has an inner monitoring system behind aquarium walls

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Look for a way to signal Smoker discreetly. A scribbled note, juice-trail message, or visual cue through the glass. Risky, but might connect.}
2. {Try to find the hidden hallway entrance. If Smoker's down there, maybe there's a service route you can slip through.}
3. {Retreat for now-head to your suite. Process what you've learned, and prep a strategy.}
4. {Visit Yazir at the docks. You're ready to see if the kebab stand's more than just a tasty rumor.}
5. {Seek out the Straw Hats. If Smoker's watching them, maybe you can *help*-or get ahead of them.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 3 - Huh. That's odd. Maybe he's on an op. Best not to mess with the man's work. I follow the server. Hey, do you know where the elevator is to floor 7? My room's up there.

OOC: Give me a window to respond if an NPC talks to my character.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 3 Selected - "Huh. Best not to get involved with the white-haired murder-machine."**  
**🎭 Tone: Polite Tourist with a Keen Eye | Strategy: Disengage from danger, relocate to secured suite**  
**🎲 Navigation Check - Calm Infiltration Toward Suite: (Eatone +2 Clever, +1 Social Subtlety) = Result: 4 [Good]**  
**🎲 Server's Demeanor - (Professionalism + Hospitality) = 3 [Fair]**  
**✅ Outcome: Success - You smoothly relocate toward your suite while maintaining your cover**

You let out a low hum behind your daiquiri, then take a sip-**damn**, it *really is good*. Limey. Cold. Clean. Like it was mixed by someone who actually knows what "subtle" means.

> *"Smoker's here... and alone. If he's not busting down doors, it's not my job to poke the cage."*

You turn from the aquarium and **follow the server**, weaving through the last cluster of clinking chips and garish fruit hats. Your body language is calm, loose, perfectly calibrated to someone who's had *just enough* to drink to be relaxed but not enough to be noticed.

> "Hey," you ask as you catch up, "do you know where the elevator is to floor 7? My room's up there."

The server glances over her shoulder and gives a polite, trained nod. Her voice is friendly-but precise, like a script she's said a hundred times today.

> "Of course, sir. That would be the **gold elevators**, just past the House of Fortune roulette tables-turn right at the crocodile fountain. You'll need your room card for access."

> "Room 703, correct? You'll have a **balcony view over the east canal**, and I believe you also have **bathrobe privileges**. The chocolate-covered cactus fruit was delivered twenty minutes ago."

She smiles wider, slightly less plastic this time, and gives a nod before peeling off with her tray of drinks.

> "Enjoy your stay, Mr. Cheng."

**🎯 You are now heading to the Guest Elevator - Floor 7 Access Only**  
**Status: Unbothered, Unflagged, In Motion Toward Private Quarters**  
**Time: Mid-Evening | Casino lights in full swing | Security Presence: Medium**  
**Drink in Hand: One Daiquiri (Perfect)**  
**Distraction Status: Security Tail = Eliminated, Smoker = Engaged Elsewhere**

---

You follow her directions: past the gold-trimmed **House of Fortune roulette tables**, around the giant **gilded crocodile fountain** (its mouth still gushing suspiciously milky mineral water), and finally find the **elevator bank**.

Four doors. Three marked for public floors. One-**gold-trimmed and marked "Balcony Level Suites Only"**-has a slot for your room key.

You slide it.

**Green light. Ding. Doors open.**

The elevator is empty.

A single **ballad version of Binks' Sake** plays softly as you ascend. You watch your reflection in the mirrored walls, drink in one hand, other resting lightly over the inner pocket that contains your **Seastone-tipped baton**-just in case.

**The elevator dings again. Floor 7.**

Doors part.

A wide, marble hallway stretches out. Plush carpeting muffles your steps. **Lanterns flicker** with soft, golden light. Each door is sleek, numbered in gold-701, 702...

**703. Your room. Waiting.**

---

**Do you enter your suite, Mr. Cheng?**

1. {Yes, enter quietly. Check the room for bugs, traps, or guests. You are in enemy territory, after all.}
2. {Wait-listen at the door first. Maybe someone got here *before* you.}
3. {Knock lightly first. If someone answers, well... then something's very wrong.}
4. {Leave a juice-slick tripline in front of the door, then open it from the side. Just in case.}
5. {Do something unexpected: knock on a *neighboring* room, pretend you're lost, and test who else is on this floor.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 1 - Where's that free snack they said they delivered?

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected - "Let's see what 703's got. Starting with that chocolate-covered cactus fruit."**  
**🎭 Tone: Alert but Casually Curious | Approach: Routine Room Entry with Discreet Security Sweep**  
**🎲 Trap/Bug Check (Eatone +2 Careful, +1 Devil Fruit Sensory, +1 Teacher-Level Paranoia) = 6 [Great]**  
**🎯 Outcome: Suite is clear of traps-but not *untouched.* The snack? Present. But suspicious.**

---

You slide the keycard into the door of **Room 703**.

The lock clicks with a soft *chime*, and the door swings open with a whisper.

Cool, *fragranced* air greets you-citrus-sandalwood, faint, like someone wanted to evoke "desert breeze" but ended up with "art teacher's office."

**The room is... absurdly nice.**

A **circular king-size bed** dominates the center, wrapped in light cream linens with a crocodile-shaped chocolate resting on the pillow. One wall is made entirely of **glass**, opening onto a private balcony with a view of **the eastern canal**, where the wind off the water carries occasional smells of spices and salt.

A chaise lounge rests near the window. A **mini-bar** hums softly.

And sitting neatly atop the **glass coffee table** beside a folded plush bathrobe is a **white porcelain dish**, upon which rests-

### 🥭 *A piece of chocolate-covered cactus fruit*

Perfectly cut. Dusted with gold-leaf flakes. A tiny **parchment label** sticks out of it like a cocktail flag.

> "**Rain Dinners Welcomes You - May Fortune Bloom in the Dunes!**"

You don't take a bite. Not yet.

Instead, you begin a **methodical sweep**, trained both by bounty work and the unshakeable instincts of a man who once confiscated 17 makeshift blowguns in a middle school science fair.

### 🔍 Sweep Results:

- **Windows**: Functional, not sealed. Can be opened fully. Escape route viable.
- **Air vents**: Clean. No signs of bugs or gas-release systems.
- **Bedding**: Untouched. Firm pillows. Nothing hidden beneath.
- **Mini-bar**: Stocked with standard drinks and juice boxes labeled "Fruit Punch!" (you wince).
- **Ceiling tiles**: Fixed tight. No crawlspace access.
- **Walls**: Normal plaster overlay-no strange echoes suggesting hollow compartments.
- **Snack**: Visually safe. No visible powder, residue, or discoloration. Smells sweet and faintly herbal.  

But...

Your **Devil Fruit-enhanced juice-sense** prickles faintly near the snack. *Moisture's been disturbed.* Not added-*moved.* Like someone touched the plate and then adjusted it *perfectly back into place.*

> Someone was *in this room* after the snack was delivered.

And they were **careful**.

No cameras. No wire taps. But someone was watching-testing your presence?
