<pre>on't fight it.

You don't need to.

---

You sit there.

A man who was **never supposed to be here.**

A man who **became exactly what was needed**.

---

And for now?

That's enough.

---

**OOC:**

Would you like to:

1. {Be found by Vivi. She knows this grief, intimately.}  
2. {Take a long walk before facing the Marines. Let the weight settle.}  
3. {Stand up, and move forward. It's time.}

>> USER: Option 1 - Stare at the monument a bit longer, then stand up.

**POV: You**  
**Tone: Quiet | Mood: Gentle Sorrow, Earned Camaraderie, Grace**

---

You stare a little longer.

Not reading now.

Just... watching.

The cactus doesn't move much. But the wind keeps the garden breathing around it-small gusts that shift the blossoms, tug lightly at the ribbons tied to plaques. A gust that dances around the aloe and settles somewhere against your chest like it, too, knows this ache.

---

You speak, just loud enough for the sky to hear:

> "I didn't even know them."

> "And I miss them anyway."

---

No answer comes.

Not right away.

But then-**soft footsteps on stone.**

Not the quick march of a Marine.

Not the heavy stomp of palace guards.

But the soft, careful steps of someone who's done this walk before.

---

You don't turn.

You don't have to.

You *know* it's her.

---

**Vivi steps beside you**, arms folded loosely, hands tucked under the long sleeves of her shawl. She says nothing at first.

Just stands there.

With you.

Looking at the same names.

The same flowers.

The same impossible question.

---

After a moment, her voice breaks the silence-not to fill it, but to *join it.*

> "I used to come here every morning."

> "Even when the city was still smoldering. Even when the rebels still didn't trust me."

---

You glance at her, but she's still facing the monument.

> "Sometimes I'd leave flowers," she says softly. "Sometimes I'd just... stand here."

> "Like maybe if I stood long enough, one of them would come back."

A pause.

> "No one ever did."

---

Her eyes flick toward you.

> "But then I met someone who made me think maybe... someone could come back for someone else."

---

Your throat tightens.

She smiles-*not brightly*, not this time.

But something more real.

---

> "You weren't just a tourist."

> "You were a witness."

> "And witnesses don't forget the names."

---

She looks at the cactus again.

Then nudges your elbow with hers.

> "Come on, pineapple."

> "You've got more names to protect."

---

And with that-

She starts walking.

Not ahead.

Not behind.

**Beside you.**

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Head to the Marine training yard. Your second promise of the day awaits.}  
2. {Ask Vivi to join you a little longer. There's more you want to ask.}  
3. {Say nothing-walk beside her. Let the story carry forward quietly.}

>> USER: Option 3 - Head back to meet up with Tashigi, but walk alongside Vivi. Do you think your father's going to hold the knee thing against me? I need to know if I should plan to evacuate the country.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Palace Garden Exit, Path to the Training Grounds]**  
**Scene: "Knees and Consequences"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Light | Mood: Healing Through Humor, Quiet Trust**

---

The two of you walk side-by-side through the dappled garden path.

The quiet of remembrance gives way, like a curtain parting, to the familiar rhythm of footfalls over palace stone, and the far-off clink of training sabers in the courtyard beyond.

You breathe a little deeper now.

Still sore.

Still tired.

But walking forward.

---

You glance sideways at Vivi as the garden's edge looms near.

> "Hey... quick question."

She arches a brow.

> "Yes, pineapple?"

You groan audibly.

> "Do *not* let that name catch on in the Royal Records."

She gives you the smuggest smile you've seen from her yet.

> "Too late. I'm having it embroidered on your welcome plaque."

---

You press on with mock gravity:

> "Right. Well, assuming my *fruit moniker* doesn't end up engraved in history..."

You clear your throat.

> "Think your dad's going to hold that whole â€˜lightly thwacking his royal kneecap' thing against me?"

You glance at her seriously.

> "I need to know if I should start planning a hasty boat ride to literally-anywhere-else-ville."

---

She stops walking.

You halt beside her.

She turns slightly, face as regal as the desert is dry.

Then she says, deadpan:

> "Well. There *is* a precedent for light assault on royalty being punishable by thirty days of ceremonial foot-washing for the nobles."

Your soul begins to leave your body.

> "And compulsory cactus grooming."

You look like you've seen death.

> "With your teeth."

---

She breaks.

Can't hold it anymore.

Vivi laughs-head back, hand over her mouth-and it's *light* this time. Not deflective, not brave, not forced. Just ***pure joy*** escaping from the cracks war didn't break.

---

You let out a groan of defeat.

> "You are *definitely* your father's daughter."

---

> "He liked you," she says, finally calming, still grinning. "For the record."

> "You made him laugh. And you made me feel safe."

Her voice softens again. But this time, she meets your eyes fully.

> "He'll remember that longer than he'll remember the bruise."

---

The wind picks up again as the garden gates swing open.

Beyond them?

**The training yard.**

You see **Tashigi**, already in uniform, barking orders at recruits.

She hasn't seen you yet.

---

Vivi nods toward her.

> "Go on, Sensei."

> "There's a whole army that needs some adult supervision."

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Join Tashigi and assist with the training-get to work.}  
2. {Say something to Vivi before parting. Something you've been holding onto.}  
3. {Just give her a look. One of shared meaning, gratitude, and no words.}

>> USER: Option 2 - I kept the promise. To you.

Join Tashigi for the patrol around the city.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Garden Gate, Parting with Purpose]**  
**Scene: "A Promise Kept"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Earnest | Mood: Resolved, Quietly Intimate, Forward Moving**

---

You pause just before stepping through the archway toward the clamor of the yard.

Boots on gravel.  
Shouts of discipline.  
The steady rhythm of a city-and a future-being rebuilt through repetition and sweat.

---

But first...

You turn back.

Vivi stands a few paces behind you, framed by flowering stone and desert bloom. The morning sun catches in her hair, outlining her in gold like the world itself knows what she's done.

She meets your gaze-bright and curious, not quite expecting anything more. Maybe assuming you'd just nod, or wave, or throw a sarcastic pineapple pun over your shoulder.

---

Instead, you say it.  
Quiet. Clear. Real.

> "I kept the promise."

A beat.

> "To you."

---

She blinks once.

The wind rustles her shawl.

And something deep in her chest shifts-just enough for her to visibly *exhale*.

Her shoulders drop.  
Not in fatigue.  
In *relief.*

---

No grand declarations.  
No swearing of eternal fealty.  
No fireworks.

Just **a promise kept**.

And a man who stood where he said he would.

---

She nods once, eyes a little shinier than before.

> "I know."

---

You give her the smallest, softest smile.

Then turn and walk through the gate-**into your next job.**

---

### [ALUBARNA - MARINE TRAINING FIELD / CITY PATROL MUSTER]

Tashigi doesn't even look up from her clipboard as you approach.

> "You're late."

You gesture vaguely toward your lingering trauma.

> "I was being emotionally vulnerable in a cactus garden."

> "Also, I nearly cried. That buys me, like, ten minutes."

---

She sighs, scribbles something.

Then jerks her chin toward the recruits forming up near the outer wall.

> "We're on city patrol today. Low-risk. Civil unrest's mostly cooled, but we're keeping a presence near food lines and the hospital wards."

> "We walk. We watch. We listen."
