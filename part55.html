<pre>king without turning it into a reprimand.

**Tashigi.**

---

Vivi doesn't turn.

She nods.

> "I know."

A beat.

> "He came here on vacation."

Tashigi walks forward slowly, stopping just behind her.

> "I've seen soldiers freeze in combat. Trained marines."  
> "He didn't."

Vivi breathes in.

> "He did what none of us could."

Tashigi doesn't respond at first. But her fists tighten.

> "He's not like us. He wasn't raised for this. He has no rank. No call to duty. Just..."  
> "Instinct."

She exhales slowly.

> "And it nearly got him killed."

---

Vivi looks over her shoulder.

> "But it saved me."

Their eyes meet.

---

> "I don't think he could live with himself if he hadn't tried."

Tashigi crosses her arms.

> "Then maybe he's the only real â€˜officer' among us."

They both glance down at Eatone as **Chopper gently fusses over his bandages**, muttering, "I swear to the stars, I need a juice-specific medical textbook..."

---

For a while, neither woman speaks.

But they don't leave.

Not yet.

Because they both know...

> You can't just **watch** someone break themselves for you,  
> and **walk away unchanged.**

---

**OOC:**  
Eatone remains unconscious.  
Tashigi and Vivi share a quiet moment-bonded by guilt, respect, and something they can't name.

Would you like time to pass until you awaken aboard duck-back in the desert, or wake here, surrounded by both of them?

>> USER: OOC: another moment passes

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora Riverbank - The Breath Between Battles]**  
**Scene: "The Afterglow of Fire"**  
**Tone: Wounded Stillness | Mood: Bond Forged in Silence**

---

The wind has settled.

The battle's scorch marks are now just shallow craters, and the smell of gunpowder is giving way to sun-baked fruit from the remnants of juice scorched into the sand.

The river drifts lazily nearby, the only real sound in the stillness aside from the occasional crack of a cooking fire or Zoro's snore.

**Eatone** remains unconscious-his body an exhausted map of the fight.

---

**Vivi** hasn't moved far.

She sits cross-legged near his head, gaze distant now, a hand resting lightly on the hilt of her slasher rings, as if reflexively checking they're still there.

---

**Tashigi**, still nearby, has taken a seat in the sand as well.

But not beside Vivi.

Just... close enough.  
Close enough to listen, but far enough to pretend she isn't.

---

Another moment passes.

The silence doesn't demand to be broken.

But it **invites** it.

---

**Vivi speaks.**

Quiet. Soft.

> "He didn't do it because I'm a princess."

A pause.

> "He didn't flinch. Not when the cannon fired. Not when that monster tried to cut me in half."

She smiles faintly, but it's hollow.

> "He didn't even hesitate."

---

Tashigi doesn't respond. She looks at the horizon.

Then, quietly:

> "That scares me more than if he had."

---

The two women sit there, not as warrior and royalty, but just two people who watched someone **break themselves** to protect someone else.

A stranger.  
A friend.  
A fool.  
A teacher.

---

> *And maybe something more.*

---

The wind picks up again-just slightly.

In the distance, the **quacks of the Royal Spot-Billed Duck Squad** echo across the dunes.

---

**OOC:**  
The ducks are arriving.  
This is the final beat of the riverbank scene.

Would you like to wake up now-confused, groggy, and surrounded-or let them load you onto a duck and wake mid-desert travel?

>> USER: OOC: awake mid travel

>> ASSISTANT: **[Desert Crossing - On the Back of a Spot-Billed Duck]**  
**Scene: "Heat, Sand, and Consequences"**  
**Tone: Groggy Awakening | Mood: Quiet After the Storm**

---

Your first thought is that you're drowning in syrup.

Sticky. Warm. Smelling faintly of tropical fruit and *regret.*

Your second thought is that your ribs are grinding like chalk.

---

You groan softly-**barely audible** over the rush of wind and flapping feathers.

Your body shifts, jostled gently by the **rhythmic gait** of something large, soft, and feathery beneath you.

You're not on sand.

You're on...

> *A duck?*

A massive, powerful **Royal Spot-Billed Duck**, to be exact.  
Its saddle is just wide enough to carry two-maybe three if someone sits awkwardly.  
And judging by the **hair brushing your shoulder**, you're not riding solo.

---

Your vision flickers.

Everything is gold-sky, sand, the glint of sun on far-off dunes.  
Heat shimmers across the horizon, and the only shade is the scarf fluttering from the duck's head.

You shift, just slightly, and pain lances through your side.

> "Gah-fucking fruit-who ordered the cannonball-"

---

"*You're awake.*"

The voice beside you is unmistakable.

**Vivi.**

Calm. Soft. Tired.

She's holding the reins with her good arm, the other freshly bandaged and resting in her lap.

She glances at you from the corner of her eye-but doesn't smile.

Not yet.

---

> "You scared the hell out of me."

A beat.

> "Again."

---

The duck quacks as if in agreement.

---

**OOC:** You are now awake, **mid-desert crossing**, between the Sandora River and the capital, Alubarna.

You are **riding with Vivi** on one of the royal ducks.  
The rest of the crew is riding ahead or behind in pairs or solo.

You're **bandaged**, bruised, and moving like hell warmed over-  
But you are alive.

---

Would you like to reply to Vivi?  
Ask where you are?  
Stay silent?

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your moment.}

>> USER: Geh, what the fuck, where the fuck, who the fuck I spit out, my bearings completely lost

Then I cringe at the headache that thinking brings 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Desert Crossing - Pain, Ducks, and Decency]**  
**Scene: "Crisis Recovery: Stage One - Swearing"**  
**Tone: Comic Pain | Mood: Groggy and Grounded**

---

> "Geh-what the fuck-where the fuck-*who* the fuck-"

Your voice is gravel. Your tongue's dry. Your body feels like a haunted scarecrow.

And then the **throbbing in your skull hits you like a sandbag** with a personality disorder.

> "Gnnn-head... bad... thinking: illegal..."

---

You slump forward slightly in the saddle, groaning into the surprisingly plush neck of a royal duck.

The duck **quacks sympathetically**.

Vivi glances over, lips twitching-but she doesn't quite smile.  
Instead, she shifts her posture slightly to support your sagging weight with her side.

> "You're safe," she says softly.  
> "We're en route to Alubarna. And you're riding... a duck."

She lets that sink in for a beat.

> "His name is Cruller."

The duck quacks proudly.

---

She pauses.

Then adds, deadpan:

> "He likes you. You bled all over his saddle."

---

Your brain sloshes a little in your skull as you blink through the heat haze.

The desert rolls out ahead of you-**endless gold**, with dots of distant figures duck-mounted and spread in formation.

Behind you, someone-probably Usopp-is loudly retelling your heroics in increasingly inaccurate detail.

> "-and then his fruit *exploded*, and he summoned a GIANT GREEN FIST FROM THE GODS-!"

> "That's not what happened," Nami snaps.

---

Vivi glances at you again.

Still no smile.

Just... relief.

> "You're really awake?"

---

**OOC:**  
You are **conscious, groggy**, and being kept upright by both Vivi and duck.

You may now engage in **limited conversation**, give a quip, ask what happened...  
Or fall back asleep like a champ.

ðŸŒ€ What do you do?

>> USER: I slump. This.. This better be the express duck out of Alabasta, or I'm going to flip 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Desert Crossing - Denial, Ducks, and Dread]**  
**Scene: "Not the Express Line"**  
**Tone: Dry Sarcasm | Mood: Too Tired to Panic**

---

You slump back into the saddle like a man who just lost a fight with an entire fruit basket.

One arm dangles.  
Your voice is low. Cracked. Dusted with the defeated sarcasm of someone who **really did not sign up for this.**

> "This... *better* be the express duck out of Alabasta..."

> "Or I'm going to flip."

---

**Cruller the duck quacks.** Not proudly this time. It's more like an *apologetic honk*.
