4. {Grab the winnings, fake a phone call, and **vanish into the crowd**. Something's about to shift.}
5. {Buy snacks for the crowd and announce you'll bet again. Build a following. Use it later.}

>> USER: Option 5 - Waitress! daiquiris for everyone, put it on my tab! I wave magnanimously at the gathered gamblers.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 5 Selected - "Daiquiris for *everyone!*"**  
**🎭 Tone: Loud, Generous, Gloriously Distracting | Mood: Riding High on Gator Glory**  
**🎲 Influence Roll - (Eatone +2 Rapport, +2 Current Fame, +1 Juice Aura) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎯 Outcome: You don't just win the crowd-you *own* the moment. You are now *a casino folk hero*.**

---

You step forward, raising your daiquiri like **a hero returning from sea**, the crowd still roaring from Snack Pack's brutal aquatic victory.

> "Waitress!"  
> "**Daiquiris for everyone!** Put it on my tab!"

A collective gasp, followed by a **howl of celebration**, erupts through the Banana Gator RumbleDome. Glasses clink, arms fly in the air, and at least three people start chanting your name incorrectly.

> "*CHUNG! CHUNG! CHUNG!*"  
> "It's Cheng, you desert raisins!"  
> "CHENG! CHENG! CHENG!"

The waitress gives you a stunned look, then grins and salutes with her tray.

> "Right away, Mr. Cheng!"

Servers scramble into action. Snail bartenders start lining up daiquiris in rapid succession, trays of glowing glasses fanning out like wings of a party god. One woman faints. A man proposes to his date. Another guy starts crying, whispering:

> "That man... that man *believed in Snack Pack.*"

You wave magnanimously, the gold-lettered velvet pouch of your winnings tucked subtly beneath your travel jacket. You've created **a perfect social smokescreen**.

The pit boss stops mid-step.

He sees the crowd chanting. The daiquiris flowing. The building momentum of an unscripted legend-and, perhaps wisely, decides now's *not* the time to crack down on the high roller who's turned the casino floor into a party zone.

He nods stiffly and pulls back. For now.

**📝 Game State Update:**

- 💰 Berri: 4,300  
- 🏷️ Reputation: "*The Juice High Roller of 703*"  
- 🃏 Status: Untouchable (for now) - No one wants to interrupt the guy who just **created an economy of daiquiris**  
- ⚠️ But security is still watching. Smiling. Letting you play. The kind of smile that means *"we'll remember this."*

**While the daiquiris flow and gators rest, you catch a flash again-**the **woman in blue** slipping behind a false wall near a **"Staff Only" corridor** by the aquarium exit. She's moving fast now.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Now's your chance. Use the distraction to follow the woman in blue. Everyone's looking at you-not where you're going.}
2. {Keep playing the hero. Talk to gamblers, start planting seeds-ask about weird events, Crocodile sightings, or disappearances.}
3. {Approach the pit boss directly. "Got a suite full of gator tokens. Care to comp a bottle of something aged?" Feel him out.}
4. {Disappear. Quietly. Slip back toward the suite or a service hallway while the party shields your exit.}
5. {Take the stage. Make a toast. Build full social dominance. It's absurd-but it might give you god-tier influence in Rain Dinners.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 3 - Keep an eye on that staff only corridor. Good sir, do you have something more... Vintage? I'd like to treat my new friends here, I wave at the crowd.

And snack pack, of course.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 3 Selected - "A vintage for the people. And the gator."**  
**🎭 Tone: Gentleman Gambler | Public Image: Benevolent Baron of the Gator Ring**  
**🎲 Social Roll - Charm Offensive (Eatone +2 Rapport, +1 High Roller Aura, +1 Crowd Favor) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Pit Boss Resistance - (Cautious +2, Momentarily Overwhelmed -1) = Result: 1 [Average]**  
**✅ Outcome: Success - You gain access to the pit boss's trust, taste something rare, and keep a close eye on the staff corridor.**

---

The daiquiris are still flowing, the crowd still roaring, and somewhere behind you, **Snack Pack** is attempting to climb out of the tank to receive the affection of his new god.

You turn, just in time to intercept the **pit boss**, whose gold-trimmed suit is sweating with regret. He forces a professional smile as you approach, raising your glass high.

> "Good sir," you begin smoothly, nodding with the practiced grace of someone who once taught **an etiquette unit to fifteen-year-olds with throwing stars.**  
> "Do you have something more... *vintage*? I'd like to treat my new friends here."

You gesture dramatically toward the **half-drunken daiquiri horde**, now singing a song that may or may not include the lyrics:

> "HE'S THE JUICE, THE FRUIT, THE CROC-SUIT FLUTE-CHENG!"

Even the pit boss, a man who has probably seen **fire-eaters**, **con men**, and **live octopus auctions**, falters. Then clears his throat.

> "Ahem. Mr. Cheng. Of course. We appreciate a guest with such... festive flair."

He signals to a passing server and mutters into her ear.

> "Bring the... Mizu Gold '27."

> "The entire bottle, sir?" she replies, eyes wide.

> "He just gave away 50 daiquiris and won 3,000 berri betting on a *psychotic reptile*, didn't he? Yes. The bottle."

She dashes off, and the pit boss steps closer.

> "I've never seen a guest build that kind of... momentum before. If there's *anything* you need, Mr. Cheng-private lounge, more tokens, even a little extra *luck* on your side..."  
> "Well, we take care of our winners."

His tone lowers, just slightly. Eyes sharp.

> "But... it's worth mentioning. Our staff areas are *off-limits.* Just in case you get... *curious.* You understand."

**At the same time-**

Your eyes flick over his shoulder, just as the **"Staff Only" corridor** opens briefly to admit a figure in blue. **Royal blue**, with gold trim. She's quick, covering her face now. *Definitely not a dancer.*

**Definitely that woman.**

And-**she was carrying something. A satchel. Possibly a map.**

The door seals shut. Unmarked. But you now know **exactly** where it is.

---

**Shortly after-**

The server returns with a **black velvet bottle**, the cork sealed in gold wax.

> **Mizu Gold '27 - Aged Sparkling Sake from Water 7**  
> "Notes: peach blossom, stonefruit, rare as hell, used in noble ceremonies. Last bottle in Rainbase."

She pours a single glass. You raise it toward the crowd. They cheer like Snack Pack just got elected King of the Sea.

Snack Pack slaps the tank wall twice in approval.

3. {Keep entertaining. Announce a final bet, then disappear while the floor is cheering again.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 2 - Hey, you're part of the crowd too. Have a glass! 

Keep eyeing the staff corridor. Ponder whether I should notify security. Something's going on there.
