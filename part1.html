Starting Scenario: From One Piece canon, the middle of the Alabasta arc - from the wiki:
Arriving in Rainbase: Crocodile's Plan Unveiled
Before we begin, please summarize this portion of the Alabasta arc from One Piece canon, as Vivi and the Straw Hats just arrive in Rainbase, while Crocodile delegates missions to his Baroque Works Office Agents of their respective tasks for the final takeover of Alabasta. The Straw Hats have not entered Rain Dinners yet. Then load it into your memory. You may go over the 5000 word limit for this summary.

Do not place my character in yet.

**ðŸŒ€ Canonical Summary - One Piece: Alabasta Arc | Act III: Rainbase, Crocodile's Plan Unveiled**

---

**Setting the Stage: Alabasta's Crisis**

The desert kingdom of **Alabasta** stands on the edge of civil war. Once a thriving monarchy under **King Nefertari Cobra**, the kingdom is now fractured by unrest, drought, and rebellion. The people blame their monarch for the country's suffering, while the true mastermind behind the chaos remains hidden in the shadows-**Sir Crocodile**, one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea and the president of the secret criminal organization **Baroque Works**.

Under the codename **Mr. 0**, Crocodile has manipulated events across Alabasta, orchestrating a coup d'Ã©tat using subterfuge, misinformation, and assassinations. His ultimate goal is the **Poneglyph** hidden beneath **Alubarna**, which he believes will grant him the **Pluton**, an ancient weapon of mass destruction.

**Rainbase: The City of Dreams**

At the edge of the desert lies **Rainbase**, a coastal resort city and gambling mecca. The city houses **Rain Dinners**, a grand casino operated-and secretly fortified-by Crocodile. It doubles as Baroque Works' regional command center. Protected by canals and traps, Rain Dinners is nearly impenetrable to the average citizen or pirate, and serves as Crocodile's temporary base of operations during this phase of his plan.

The city's tone is paradoxical: vibrant on the surface with laughing tourists and gleaming towers, but humming underneath with tension, corruption, and secrets. Navy presence is weak</pre>
