🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - Keep poking at the lock, try to push up the pins with kiwi juice hydraulics.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected - "Hydraulic Kiwi Key: Citrus Lockpicking Edition"**  
**Tone: Focused Improvisation | Action: Pick the Lock Using Fruit Physics**  
**🎲 Precision Fruit Engineering - (Eatone +2 Devil Fruit Control, +1 Lock Theory, +1 Improvised Pressure System) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎲 Lock Integrity - (Hardened +2, Corroded -2, Improvised Maintenance -1) = Result: -1 [Disastrous]**  
**✅ Outcome: You don't just pick the lock. You *dominate* it. It gives way under your controlled pressure like it was made of butter. The cage connection is now **unlatched**-ready to open.**

---

You grit your teeth, lower your stance, and put all your focus into the twitching, **fibrous juice strand** inside the lock.

> "Alright... let's play house, Kiwi style."

You shift your fingers like you're manipulating a marionette, and inside the lock, the juice responds-**swelling in micro-pulses**, like little flexing muscles.

> Push.  
> Curl.  
> Stretch.  
> Compress.

The juice splits into five *sub-filaments*, each one **pressing upward like miniature pistons**.

> *click... click-clickclickclick-*  
> **KA-CHUNK!**

The lock **jolts open**, the pins fully disengaged by the *hydraulic pulse* of your fruit's power. You hear the satisfying **clang** of a broken seal and watch as the **reinforced latch arm swings wide**, now **free of the cage's hanging rig**.

The cage rocks, no longer tethered from above. Still held by side supports-but now?  
**Loosened. Exposed. One good push or pull could break it open.**

---

Tashigi sees the shift and whispers:

> "You got it?"

You don't even look up.

> "It never stood a chance."

---

**Inside the cage:**

Zoro blinks.

> "...He just unlocked the cage.  
With *fruit juice.*"

Nami: "I'm not sure whether to thank him or report him to the Science Division."

Chopper: "He's *amazing!*"

Vivi's hand touches the cage's edge. She feels it.

> Loose.

She turns to the others and nods once.

> *"Get ready."*

---

**📝 Status Update:**

- **Cage Lock: Unlatched. Free.**  
- The bars are still solid, but the cage is now **ready to open or break with help.**  
- Straw Hats: Primed. Zoro and Nami look ready to assist.  
- Tashigi: Still watching your back. Blade up. No interruptions yet.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Motion to Zoro. "Kick it." Let raw power break the rest open. He's got the legs.}  
2. {Have Tashigi slice the now-free connecting latch-completely disengage the cage.}  
3. {Build a juice platform below the cage. If it opens wrong, give them something to land on.}  
4. {Climb atop the cage. Use your baton to knock the loosened top free.}  
5. {Signal everyone inside-"Push." It'll take all of them, but they can break it open with weight and timing.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 5 - ​Hold out my arm. If they can get the door opened, try to catch them.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 5 Selected - "Come on, kids. I've got you."**  
**Tone: Quiet Resolve | Action: Human Cushion Protocol Activated**  
**🎲 Readiness Roll - (Eatone +2 Reaction Time, +1 Bracing for Impact, +1 Moral Resolve) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Straw Hat Coordination - (Zoro +2, Nami +1, Vivi +2, Chopper +1) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎯 Outcome: The team inside sees your signal. They force the cage open from within. You brace-and *you catch them*. Kiwi-soaked, bruised, but heroic.**

---

You lower yourself slightly, feet wide, arms out, and brace against the slick metal of the cage platform.

> "Alright...  
Let's go, kids."

You hold your arm out toward the caged crew like a lifeguard waiting at the deep end of a very stupid pool.

---

**Inside the cage:**

Zoro nods at you once.  
Then shoves his shoulder into the side of the gate-**metal groaning** as the now-unlatched section **buckles**.

Nami jams her heel into the gap with a loud grunt, shoving upward like she's kicking a tax form off a desk.  
Vivi and Chopper **pull from the inside**, while Zoro drives forward again-

> *KRK-KRAKK!*

The latch gives.

The door **flies open**-not gracefully, but *defiantly*-and in a half-fall, half-scramble:

> **They spill out.**

Zoro lands on one leg and spins sideways to absorb the force.  
Nami nearly stumbles, and **you grab her arm**, pulling her forward.  
Vivi doesn't hesitate-she **dives**, and you **catch her cleanly**, cradling her for just a breath before setting her down.

Chopper lands like a cat.

Luffy?

Still slumped in the back.

> But breathing. Twitching. **Stirring.**

---

Tashigi's eyes widen as the cage empties.

> "You *caught them.* All of them."

You grin, a little winded.

> "Had to. I'm a teacher."

---

**Behind you, in the water:**

The Banana Gators **roar**.

They realize **dinner just left the cage.**

They're turning.

Fast.

---

**📝 Tactical Status:**

- **Cage is open. Straw Hats (minus Luffy) are free and armed with awareness.**  
- Vivi is **safe. Breathing. Strong.**  
- Luffy is still inside-but showing signs of waking.  
- Gators are **reacting. Closing in.**  
- Juice waterfall still flows above.  
- Tashigi is guarding the winch, sword drawn.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Dive into the cage. Wake Luffy. Now. The crew needs their wild card.}  
2. {Begin forming a juice wall between the Gators and the platform. You'll hold them.}  
3. {Yell: "Up the waterfall! Go!" Start evacuating the crew, Luffy last.}  
4. {Toss a juice bomb into the Gator pit. Scatter them-hard.}  
5. {Ask Zoro: "Can you carry Straw Hat?" Coordinate for a clean, fast evac.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 5 - That's a Seastone cage, I ain't going in there. You got the other kid, green? Stand defensively between Tashigi, the rest of the crew, and the Bananagators.

>> ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 5 Selected - "I ain't stepping foot in that Seastone tomb. Green guy, you're up."**  
**Tone: Tactical Command with Full Citrus Spine | Action: Delegate the Rescue, Take the Defense**  
**🎲 Command Effectiveness - (Eatone +2 Tactical Clarity, +1 Calm Under Pressure) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Zoro Response - (+2 Loyalty to Luffy, +1 Recognition of Authority, +1 Pirate Muscle Memory) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎲 Defensive Stand - (Eatone +2 Juice Combat Readiness, +1 Baton Braced, +1 Environmental Awareness) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**✅ Outcome: Zoro bolts into the cage without hesitation. You plant yourself like a damn adult against a trio of reptilian nightmares. You are the wall between predators and your evac.**

---

You throw your arm out to stop Tashigi from moving forward, eyes locked on the Gator pit, and shout low and sharp to the swordsman now standing beside you:

> "That's a Seastone cage. I ain't stepping in.  
**You** got the other kid-**Green.**"

Zoro locks eyes with you.

> "On it."

No questions. No sass. Just motion.

He **vaults the twisted cage door** with the ease of someone who's done this a hundred times, one hand grabbing the edge, the other already reaching for Luffy's collar.

Inside, you hear the rasp of steel on metal as he adjusts the hilt at his side.

> "Hey, Captain. Time to wake up. We got work to do."

---

Meanwhile, you step forward.

One boot splashes on the slick metal. Your **baton comes up**, Seastone tip gleaming in the dim light.

Your juice hand flicks once-**three droplets fly out** and harden mid-air into **suspended tripwires**, thin as silk and ten times as sticky.

> **You are the wall.**

Behind you:  
- **Tashigi**, sword up, eyes scanning.  
- **Nami**, holding Chopper like a grenade with antlers.  
- **Vivi**, shoulder squared, silent but iron-backed.

---

**Below you:**

The Banana Gators **lurch forward**, jaws wide.

One **leaps upward**, nearly catching the edge of the platform.  
Another **circles wide**, preparing to flank.

They're coming.

> And you?

You plant your feet,</pre>
