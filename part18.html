<pre> just enough to confirm your instincts.**

---

You lean slightly closer-not menacing, just friendly-and lift your now-empty glass in a mock toast.

> "Hey, how about I get you a drink when you're off shift?  
I'm sure you've got some stories, yeah? Places like this... always have stories."  
> "I know I do."

There's a pause.

You expect a polite brush-off. But instead, his jaw shifts like someone grinding down a reflex.

> "...Heh. I'll think about it, sir."

He glances over at the crowd-still laughing, drinking, roaring as **Snack Pack body-slams a floaty gator toy** in an unprompted aquatic display of dominance.

> "Could probably use one. This place ain't exactly quiet lately."

He catches himself and straightens. Looks away, neutral again-but too late.

That one little comment?  
**He let something slip.**

And he knows it.

You keep it cool, just smiling.

> "I'll be around. Cheng. Room 703."  
> "Look me up after clock-out."

He doesn't answer-but he doesn't say no. You walk away casually, returning to your spot, **a little richer in trust and intel.**

---

**üìù What You Gained:**

- The guard has accepted you as **socially safe.** You're no longer just a guest-you're a "harmless regular."
- He **confirmed instability behind the scenes** without meaning to. "Place ain't quiet lately" = pressure is building.
- He's on edge, but warming up. Might talk more *off shift*-a potential ally or leak later.
- Still never gave his name. That's deliberate.

---

**Time Check: 6 Minutes Since Tashigi Entered**  
**Corridor: Still Quiet**  
**Guard: Relaxed, but alert. Eyes follow movement, especially VIPs.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Return to the bar. Prep to leave. If she doesn't come out soon... she might *not.*}
2. {Wait at your table. Eyes on the door. Two more minutes, then you act.}
3. {Create a distraction-shouting match, a staged banana spill, something to pull the guard's focus if you need a fast move.}
4. {Find one of the floor servers you tipped earlier. Quietly ask if there's another way into staff areas.}
5. {Send a trickle of juice beneath the corridor door. Just enough to scout. No combat-just surveillance.}

üåÄ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 3 - Hey! When's the next race? Snack Pack craves blood! And wins! Mostly blood!

>> ASSISTANT: **üé≤ Option 3 Selected - "Snack Pack hungers for glory... and maybe a little bit of gator spleen."**  
**üé≠ Tone: Over-the-Top Gambler Energy | Intent: Crowd Distraction + Guard Misdirection**  
**üé≤ Distraction Roll - (Eatone +2 Performance, +2 Public Momentum, +1 Gator Fandom Cult Leader Status) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**üéØ Outcome: You create a full-scale crowd frenzy. Security attention shifts. The guard is momentarily compromised.**

---

You throw your arms up like a preacher channeling divine revelation through a tropical cocktail.

> "**HEY!**" you shout across the Gator RumbleDome.  
> "When's the **next race?!** My boy **Snack Pack** craves **blood and glory**!  
AND WINS! MOSTLY BLOOD!!"

The crowd **explodes.**  
Drinks slosh. Someone yells, "**Snack Pack for the Shichibukai!**"  
Another patron whips off their shirt and slaps it onto the tank glass like a banner of war.

The announcer-clearly still recovering from the last round-fumbles the golden snail mic:

> "U-UH-THE NEXT RACE BEGINS IN... TEN MINUTES! SPECIAL EXHIBITION ROUND!"  
> "REPEAT: SNACK PACK WILL RACE-AGAINST THREE CHALLENGERS!"

A **bell rings**, unprompted. Staff scramble. **Spotlights spin.**  
The crowd swells toward the arena edge, everyone jostling for position, drunk on juice, booze, and Snack Pack fever.

---

### **What Happens to the Guard:**

Your antics draw **every eye in the vicinity**, including his.

He turns his head.  
**Just a second too long.**

You see him reach for his Den Den Mushi-*maybe to report, maybe to listen in*-but it doesn't matter.

> He's distracted.  
> The corridor? **Unguarded. For the moment.**

---

**Time Check: 8 Minutes Since Tashigi Entered**  
**Crowd Status: Frenzied, Screaming for Gator Blood**  
**Corridor Status: Unwatched, Unlocked, Wide Open**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Slip into the corridor. Quiet, quick, just far enough to find Tashigi-or what's left of her.}
2. {Send a thread of juice beneath the door while everyone's distracted. Stealth recon.}
3. {Use your popularity to bluff deeper: "As Snack Pack's sponsor, I demand a backstage tour!"}
4. {Wait two more minutes. Tashigi said ten. Don't break the deal-yet.}
5. {Prep a juice escape route. Just in case you need to run-or fight-soon.}

üåÄ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 1 - 8 minutes ain't 10, but it ain't 0 either. Let's take a look. Leave a kiwi trail behind me for sensing and exfil.

>> ASSISTANT: **üé≤ Option 1 Selected - "8 ain't 10... but it ain't nothin'. Let's move."**  
**üé≠ Tone: Covert, Focused, Professionally Cautious**  
**üßÉ Devil Fruit Usage: Kiuikyuui J≈´su J≈´su no Mi - Trail Activated (Passive Sensing + Escape Route)**  
**üé≤ Stealth Roll - (Eatone +2 Subtle, +1 Distraction Field, +1 Juice Control) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**üéØ Outcome: You slip into the staff corridor completely unseen, trail in place. You are now in enemy space.**

---

The crowd continues **roaring Snack Pack's name** like they're about to vote him into Parliament. Drinks are flying. Security's preoccupied with **not getting trampled** by people throwing money at the betting terminals.

You slide toward the **Staff Only door**, still cracked slightly from earlier. The guard's gaze is locked on the announcer booth-he doesn't see you vanish inside.

With a subtle **snap of your fingers**, a thin trail of **kiwi juice threads from your heel**, back across the tile, glowing faintly only to you. It anchors to the base of a cleaning cart, where it will pulse softly if tugged from either side.

> *Safety line secured. Teacher tactics engaged.*

---

**INTERIOR: Staff Corridor - Sublevel 1 Access Passage**  
- **Lighting:** Dim. Yellow halogen bulbs flickering occasionally.  
- **Sound:** Dripping pipes, faint hum of machinery, distant murmur of an aquarium pump.  
- **Smell:** Salt, oil, and faint antiseptic. Someone tried to cover up blood recently. Not very well.

The corridor stretches ahead, descending in a **gentle slope**-clearly designed for utility carts and maintenance access. Pipes line the walls. Security signs warn about **"AUTHORIZED STAFF ONLY - Surveillance Active."**

You pass:

- A **locked supply room**  
- A **laundry intake chute**  
- A **maintenance panel** with fingerprints on it-recent.  
- And then... the **first real sign**:

### A scuff on the floor-**boot tread**, thin, regulation heel.

**Tashigi's trail.**

You follow, careful to keep your footfalls light. Every corner, you leave a fresh **sensing droplet** of kiwi juice, keeping a **light mental tether** to their location. You're maybe 25 meters in when you hear it:

> **A grunt.**  
> **Soft metal against concrete.**

You ease to the corner. Ahead is a **fork in the hallway**-one side leads to **central filtration** for the aquarium. The other toward **what looks like an elevator chamber**, its keypad **still flickering from recent input.**

And there-**on the floor near the filtration doorway**-you see her:

> **Tashigi, crouched. Alive. Breathing hard. Bleeding from her temple. Sword half-drawn.**  
> Her back is to the wall. Across from her lies the **unmoving body of a man in a casino staff uniform**-his coat open just enough to show a **Baroque Works tattoo on his ribs.**

She hasn't seen you yet. But she's **not unconscious**. She's waiting. **Cornered?** Laying a trap?

---

**üìù Current Situation:**

- You are **25 meters into the staff corridor**, unseen.  
- **Kiwi trail active** for exfil or reinforcements.  
- **Tashigi is down but conscious**, recovering from a fight.  
- One **Baroque Works agent down**-unknown if dead.  
- You are **not yet engaged.** Full element of surprise.
