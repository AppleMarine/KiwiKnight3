5. {Quiet moment-reminisce, plan, wait for the chaos to reach you.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option X - Figure I might as well introduce myself to the crew. Despite them being... Pirates. They're still kids, they need a good role model.

Walk up to any grouping of them, and clear my throat.

So, erm... Pira- kids- I mean, whatever. I'm Eatone Cheng. Part time bounty hunter, part time schoolteacher, full time kiwi juice man.

OOC: Only I control the player characters dialogue. You may paraphrase for narrative flow.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Desert Skiff - On the Dunes to Alubarna]**  
**Tone: Earnest Introduction | Mood: Mutual Curiosity, Humor, Bond-Forming**

---

The wind howls dry and relentless across the sand, the **makeshift skiff creaking** as it glides along the surface of the dunes, its passengers unified only by circumstance-and whatever snacks Chopper didn't finish.

You approach the **largest grouping of Straw Hats** clustered near the main mast-**Nami, Usopp, Chopper, and a half-conscious Luffy** reclining in a nest of gear.

A beat passes. You clear your throat.

> "So, erm... Pira-  
Kids.  
I mean-*whatever.*"

Several heads turn. Nami raises an eyebrow. Usopp squints like he's trying to gauge if this is a monologue or a warning. Chopper's eyes widen. Luffy is snoring softly.

> "I'm Eatone Cheng.  
Part-time bounty hunter.  
Part-time schoolteacher.  
Full-time kiwi juice man."

---

There's a silence. Then:

**Chopper** immediately gasps. "You're a *teacher?!* That's so cool!"

**Usopp** gestures wildly. "Wait, wait-you fight people *and* do multiplication tables?!"

**Nami**, arms crossed, tilts her head with mock suspicion. "So which came first? The juice or the teaching?"

You can feel their energy shift-not wary, not judgmental.

Just... curious.

Like kids who just found out their weird uncle used to **fight gators professionally.**

---

Even **Zoro**, overhearing from the bow, cracks a smirk.

> "Taught anyone how to smack a warlord with fruit?"

---

**Tashigi**, off to the side, watches the exchange with the faintest hint of a smile. She doesn't interrupt. Doesn't correct you. Just **lets you have it**-a moment to define yourself not as the man who stood his ground or got them out, but as the man you *are*.

Eatone Cheng.

The adult in the room.

Even if the room is on fire.  
Even if it's a boat skimming sand.  
Even if it's full of **pirates**.

---

**OOC: You've successfully established rapport. The Straw Hats now see you less as a wildcard... and more as their *own kind of adult.* Not an authority. Not a buzzkill. Just-someone who chose to help, and didn't lecture them for being young.**

You may now interact with specific crew members more naturally, or direct the next event in this arc's race.

Would you like to keep the moment light, or steer into the next serious beat (Baroque pursuit, Alubarna approach, or a moment alone with a character)?

>> USER: To Luffy - shoot a squirt of green kiwi juice into his mouth. It's sour.

To Zoro - I'm here on vacation, green. I dont, didn't, and never intend on fighting a warlord. Frankly, once we get back away from Rainbase and back on land, I'm thinking of finding the nearest ocean liner out of this country.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Desert Skiff - To Alubarna, With Citrus]**  
**Tone: Deadpan Meets Honesty | Mood: Sour Wakeups and Soft Boundaries**

---

Luffy's mouth is open in sleep, half-snoring, half-muttering something about "meat crocodiles" and "juice cannons."

You lean down, raise two fingers, and with a precise flick-

> *PHTEW!*

A **sharp squirt** of fresh kiwi juice arcs through the air and hits Luffy square in the mouth.

His lips smack once.

Then his whole body twitches.

> "*GAH-SOUR!*"

He jerks up, eyes wide, arms flailing for a second before he realizes **he's not being eaten.**

You raise a brow.

> "You're welcome."

He blinks, squints at you, and slowly grins through the sour shudder.

> "Hey... juice guy!"

Then falls immediately back into his nap.

---

You stroll over toward **Zoro**, who's leaning against a crate with a sword laid across his legs, the sun glinting off his earrings. He doesn't look at you, but his eye shifts your way the second you start talking.

> "Just so we're clear, green-  
I'm here on vacation.  
Didn't plan on fighting a Warlord. Don't.  
And once we get back to dry land?  
I'm finding the nearest ocean liner and booking it *out* of this madhouse of a country."

Zoro snorts softly.

> "Guess we all showed up here with different plans."

He sharpens his blade with slow, steady strokes.

> "You're not wrong for wanting out.  
But for a guy who doesn't want to fight Warlords... you sure keep getting in front of them."

His tone isn't accusing.  
It's observant. A hint of respect behind the sarcasm.

> "Guess we'll see what you *really* do when Crocodile shows up again."

---

**OOC: You've drawn a clear line for yourself-**you're not here for the war. You're not here to save kingdoms.

But Zoro sees through that a little.

Because you're *still here*.

---

Would you like to continue the moment, move to a private chat with Tashigi or Vivi, or shift toward the next major event: **Baroque Works intercept** or **arrival at the Sandora River crossing**?

>> USER: Getting in front of them, because you kids keep getting in front of them first. I sigh. Someone has to keep you young ones safe.

OOC: The player character is in his late 20's. A little older than Tashigi, about a decade older than most of the Straw Hats and Vivi

OOC: Vivi, Tashigi may overhear about my plan to get out of Alabasta at the earliest opportunity 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Desert Skiff - The Kiwi Protector Speaks]**  
**Tone: Dry and Earnest | Mood: The Weight of Adulthood Among Youth**

---

> "Getting in front of them," you say, glancing sideways at Zoro,  
> "because you *kids* keep getting in front of them first."

You let out a sigh, the wind catching your coat as your gaze trails over the lot of them-snoring Luffy, starry-eyed Chopper, Usopp mumbling something about "hero rankings" in his sleep.

> "Someone's gotta keep you young ones safe."

Zoro's lips twitch-not quite a smile. Not quite not. He doesn't argue. He just looks out over the dunes, blade still balanced on his knees.

> "You're not as old as you act, you know."

> "Tell that to my back."

---

Behind you, **Vivi** shifts at the mast, her eyes having trailed your voice mid-conversation.

She's been quiet-watching, weighing, the burden of a kingdom heavy on her shoulders.

**Tashigi**, seated near the sail's crank, freezes mid-check of the rudder.

They both heard what you said earlier.  
> That when this is over, you're gone.  
> Vacation's over.  
> No more heroics.  
> Just... out.

---

**Vivi**, her voice soft, floats over the roar of sand:

> "You're not *that* much older than us..."

She doesn't say it like a fact.  
She says it like a protest.  
Not begging you to stay.  
Just... trying to understand why you'd go.

**Tashigi** doesn't look back, but her hand tightens just slightly around the rope she's gripping.

---

**OOC:** Your comment-casual, honest, and responsible-has been overheard.

- **Vivi**, who sees you as someone who stood beside her when few would, is now quietly wrestling with the idea of *losing another protector* before this is over.
- **Tashigi**, who already feels the guilt of your involvement, hears a man distancing himself, and it lands... hard.

They may confront you directly.  
They may stew on it.  
But the tension is now in the air.

---

**Would you like to engage with them now-clarify, stand firm, soften-or let the silence carry as you approach the Sandora River crossing and the next phase of the chase?**

>> USER: â€‹I shoot another squirt of kiwi juice into Chopper's mouth. This time, I will it to be a little sweeter than last time. Huh, why didn't I do that last time? And also why is the juice a little yellower?
