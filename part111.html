<pre>er.

You stare at the pen.

---

She raises an eyebrow.

> "Still want to file, Sensei?"

---

**OOC: Final Decision Time -**

Do you:

1. {Take the forms. The pain will be real-but so is the possibility of payoff, even if symbolic.}  
2. {Back away slowly. "On second thought, I'll just stick to government-funded housing and palace tea."}  
3. {Grab just one form-*maybe* the Paramecia declaration-for curiosity's sake.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - ...is there a deadline on filing? I can try filling out... A page a night?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Marine Field Office - Welcome to the Grind]**  
**Scene: "The Paper Path to Glory"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Committed | Mood: Mundane Heroism, Humor Meets Dread**

---

You eye the mountain of forms.  
It eyes you back.

Two hundred and seventy-six pages.  
Ink not included.  
Your soul? *Probably optional.*

---

> "...Is there a deadline on filing?" you ask, voice quiet like a man asking a doctor how many weeks he has left.

The clerk taps the top form, **Form W-BT-004**, with a perfectly manicured nail.

> "One month from the date of Warlord revocation to file your initial intent."

> "Three months to submit full documentation."

> "Or, y'know, until someone else claims they beat Crocodile first and wins the rights to bragging and whatever's left of his buried fortune."

---

You squint.

> "That *sounds* like enough time..."

> "If I fill out... one page a night?"

You pause.

> "Two if I skip dinner."

She shrugs.

> "The Marines call it *‘earning your retirement with carpal tunnel.'*"

---

She hands you a folder.

No ceremony. No music. Just **the weight of your own optimism** in slightly damp, government-issued parchment.

> "Take it home, Sensei."

> "And don't forget: ink must be **blue.** Black is for Marines. Red is for war crimes."

---

You hold the forms like they might bite.

Behind you, a younger Marine whispers to his desk partner:

> "Is that the juice guy?"

> "Yeah, I think he *fought a Warlord* and now he's filing for reimbursement like it's laundry day."

---

You don't respond.

You just tuck the folder under your arm, straighten your spine-

And head back into the light of day.

Because **this** is your legacy now:

**Battle-scarred protector. Educator of youth.  
Filer of paperwork.**

---

**OOC:**
You've officially started the **Bounty Claim Side Quest**  
(Estimated Time to Completion: 1-3 in-game months, or 6-8 long rests of miserable scribbling)

You may now:

1. {Return to the patrol with Tashigi and Kiwi-Kop.}  
2. {Check in with Vivi-the civil council meeting has likely begun.}  
3. {Take a break. Gods know, you've earned it.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - I slip the papers into the bookbag slung over my shoulder.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Back Alley, Rejoining the Patrol]**  
**Scene: "Pulp and Procedure"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Balanced | Mood: Light Resolve, Rhythm Returning**

---

The papers slide smoothly into the worn bookbag at your hip-**nestling in between old lesson plans, a half-crushed emergency granola bar, and a ballpoint pen with suspiciously little ink left.** You pat the side of the bag like a parent sealing a lunchbox.

> "One page a night," you mutter.

> "Two if I skip breakfast."

Pause.

> "...Three if I get fired anyway."

---

You step back onto the sunbaked cobblestone, rounding the corner toward the alley you left behind.

There they are.

**Tashigi's finishing the paperwork** (ironic, given your new burden), and **Kiwi-Kop stands vigilant** like a green gelatinous gargoyle-arms crossed, leaking modestly onto a stray cat, which doesn't seem to mind.

The suspect is tied, slumped, grumbling.

> "Tell your fruit slime it stepped on my dignity."

You point to the puddle near him.

> "Tell your dignity not to be so absorbent."

---

**Tashigi straightens**, brushing dust off her sleeve. Her brow rises as you reappear, the bureaucratic stink of paperwork still faintly radiating from your coat.

> "You good?"

You nod.

> "Yep. Begun the noble journey of Warlord Bounty Claim Filing Protocol Section 8-B. A hero's path."

Tashigi rolls her eyes.

> "Next thing I know you'll be issuing citations for sidewalk slippage."

---

**Kiwi-Kop emits a deep "bloop."**  
It seems... supportive.

You all stand there a moment.  
The tension of the morning-gone.  
The rhythm of rebuilding-resuming.

---

You take your baton in hand.  
You adjust your bag.  
The pages rustle once as they settle into place.

---

**You're not a warlord. Not a pirate. Not a soldier.**

You're just **you**.

But in a city full of cracks and children and quiet danger,  
**you're enough.**

---

**OOC: The day continues.**

Would you like to:

1. {Join the civil council with Vivi-policy, recovery, and long-term reconstruction.}  
2. {Continue patrolling with Tashigi through the refugee quarter. Rumors of unrest stir there.}  
3. {Take a moment to yourself. Explore your power more deeply-maybe test elemental variations.}

>> USER: ​Option X - I frown at the juice dripping off Kiwi Kop, starting to flood the nearest sewer grate.

Maybe... I should try this in a more... Permeable part of town next time. I desummon the elemental.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Side Street, Dripping With Promise]**  
**Scene: "Cleanup on Aisle Kop"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Self-Aware | Mood: Reflective, Functional, Slightly Slippery**

---

You glance down at **Kiwi-Kop**, who has taken to mimicking your posture with uncanny accuracy-one squishy arm raised thoughtfully, the other leaking slightly over the top of a storm grate that's now gurgling with concern.

A poor city maintenance worker further down the street glares at the bubbling runoff, visibly calculating the number of buckets and curse words this cleanup will take.

You wince.

> "Yeah... we probably shouldn't be letting law enforcement ooze into the plumbing."

---

With a sigh, you focus.

A familiar tug curls behind your navel-part instinct, part exhaustion, and part resignation that *maybe* not all parts of justice are biodegradable.

You hold out your hand.

> "Alright, buddy. Good shift. Time to clock out."

---

**Kiwi-Kop emits a long, drawn-out "bloo-"**

And **dissolves.**

With a polite *plop.*

A citrus-scented splash paints the cobblestones where it stood.

A single fig seed rolls into a crack and nestles there, as if in memory.

---

Tashigi, watching from a few feet away, crosses her arms and raises a brow.

> "So... fruit magic cleanup duty is part of your job now too?"

You adjust your coat, now slightly less sticky.

> "Occupational hazard of being a teacher-slash-vigilante. Also, I'm pretty sure I violated at least three environmental ordinances just now."

---

She chuckles-*actually chuckles*-and falls in beside you.

---

The sun continues rising higher.

The scent of fresh bread and market fruit wafts in from a nearby plaza.  
The echoes of rebuilding sound out from the rooftops above.

And you?

You're *still here*.

**No longer just reacting to chaos.**  
Now? You're *directing* something.

Even if it leaks.

---

**OOC: Where to next, Sensei?**

1. {Join Vivi at the palace for the civil council session. Begin long-term recovery planning.}  
2. {Continue patrol-head toward the refugee zone. Possible Baroque sympathizers have been sighted.}  
3. {Test your fruit deeper-explore new elemental variations in a private location.}

>> USER: ​Option X - You know, I know we ended up capturing Crocodile, but what happened to his other officers? All Sunday disappeared, and we never properly apprehended the ones back at the Sandora river.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - East Wall Walkway, On Patrol]**  
**Scene: "The Unfinished Ends"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Uneasy Calm, Seeds of Future Conflict**

---

You and **Tashigi** walk along the narrow wall that overlooks Alubarna's eastern quarter-below, rooftops stretch like plates laid out for a feast the kingdom hasn't quite prepared for yet. Workers hammer at scaffolds, smoke coil</pre>
