2. {Take Vivi's hand. Stay silent. Let that be your answer.}
3. {Break the silence with a joke-but mean it this time.}

>> USER: Option 3 - if I stay, Can I...

OOC: the two lean in, wondering what I'm going to say. Am I finally going to ask for something?

Can I get help filling out permanent residency forms? I've never done them before.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Gardens - The Most You Thing You Could Say]**  
**Scene: "The First Ask"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Wry, Soft | Mood: Devastatingly You, Quietly Beautiful**

---

You finally lift your head.

The wind tugs gently at your hair.

Two women-one warrior, one royal-watch you closely, hearts caught in their throats.  
They lean in, anticipation building, breaths held, because-

*This might be the moment.*

The moment you finally, finally ask for something.

The moment you admit you want to stay.

Want something more.

Want something for **you**.

---

You scratch the back of your neck, glance between them.

Your voice comes quiet.

Unassuming.

But this time... just a little *more sure*.

---

> "If I stay..."

They both lean in. Hearts pounding. Eyes wide.

You pause.

You look up at them-

Eyes honest.

Earnest.

Tired but present.

---

> "Can I get help filling out..."

A beat.

Their eyes widen.

**This is it. This is happening.**

---

> "...permanent residency forms?"

> "I've never done them before."

---

**Vivi blinks.**

**Tashigi's mouth opens.**

And for a beat-

There's absolute silence.

---

Then:

**Tashigi exhales so hard she nearly stumbles.**

> "You are... *unbelievable.*"

---

**Vivi covers her mouth with both hands**, laughter escaping in a choked, watery burst.

> "You-*you actually-*!"

She's crying.

She's laughing.

You've broken them both.

Beautifully.

---

You raise your hands, sheepish.

> "I'm just saying! I don't want to get deported. The whole â€˜fought a Warlord' thing probably doesn't count as proper documentation."

---

**Tashigi swipes a hand down her face.**

> "I will personally submit the paperwork to the capital myself."

---

**Vivi wipes her tears, cheeks glowing.**

> "And I'll approve it myself."

---

> "We'll teach you how to ask for more later," Tashigi mutters under her breath. "Right now we just need to get him a damn desk and a local ID card."

---

You laugh with them.

You finally let yourself laugh *with* them.

Because you didn't say you'd stay.

You didn't say you wanted more.

But you did something even better.

You **asked** for help staying.

And that?

That's everything they needed to hear.

---

**OOC:**
- You've chosen to stay in Alabasta.
- Vivi and Tashigi are your allies, protectors, and friends.
- For once... you're letting yourself be helped.

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {A time skip-first day as an official Alabastan resident.}  
2. {A quiet moment-late night, after the decision has settled.}  
3. {An epilogue-what the future might look like, now.}

>> USER: Option 2 - Right... First, rebuilding. Could you get me a mop and a bucket. I should go out and start cleaning off those puddles of juice before it stains or attracts any more gnats. It is my fault, after all.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Courtyard - That Night]**  
**Scene: "The First Step Forward"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Soft | Mood: Healing, Humble, Full of Quiet Dignity**

---

The stars hang heavy over Alubarna tonight.

The city's still, hushed in the aftermath of a war no one thought could be won.

Somewhere, laughter trickles from a small plaza where families light lanterns for those lost and those returned.  
Somewhere, a guardsman hums while polishing a dented helm.  
And somewhere, from the highest point of the palace, **two women still smile quietly, watching a man with a mop and a dented bucket step into the open courtyard alone.**

---

You grunt softly, dipping the mop into a bucket of now-lukewarm water. A pair of palace aides insisted on helping-but you waved them off.

You'd conjured the **kiwi elemental**.

You'd turned the palace into a **pulp-stained citrus battlefield.**

And now?

> "Right," you mutter, sloshing the mop against a sticky corner of the stone.

> "Rebuilding."

---

Your hand moves steadily, mop dragging over faint green stains that shimmer faintly under the starlight.  
There are *dozens* of puddles.  
*Hundreds* of sticky footprints.  
And at least **one palace pigeon** that keeps landing in the same slick spot with increasing frustration.

You sigh.

> "This is what I get for not leaving fruit control to professionals."

---

**Behind you, soft footsteps approach.**

Not the stride of a soldier.

Not the flutter of a dress.

**Slippers.**

Royal-but quiet.

You don't look back.

You just say:

> "Let me guess. You've got my residency forms."

---

**Vivi's voice comes with a smile:**

> "Not until you finish cleaning up your mess."

---

You glance over your shoulder.

She's wearing a pale blue robe, long sleeves rolled to her elbows, carrying *her own* bucket.

She sets it down beside yours.

No ceremony.

No fuss.

Just... two mops.

---

You blink.

> "You're a princess."

> "And this is not your job."

---

She dips the mop, gives it a twirl.

> "Neither was saving the country."

> "We all did things we weren't meant to, Eatone."

---

**Another pause.**

Then-

From the opposite walkway, **Tashigi** appears.

Half-out of uniform, hair tied back, holding what may be a third mop she *commandeered from a janitorial closet*. She doesn't say a word. Just eyes the ground like it personally offended her and starts scrubbing.

---

You stare at both of them for a long moment.

Then sigh.

> "I really was just joking about cleaning this myself."

---

**Vivi smirks.**

> "We weren't."

---

And the three of you mop in silence.

---

No speeches.

No reward.

Just three people who survived something terrible...

...deciding, together, that it's time to **start fixing what they can.**

---

And the stars above you?

They shine a little softer tonight.

Because something in Alabasta is beginning again.

And this time?

You're here for it.

---

**OOC:**

Congratulations, Sensei.

You stayed.

You chose connection.

You let yourself *want.*

And in return... you found home.

Would you like to:

1. {Time skip - your new life begins.}  
2. {An epilogue - a glimpse far ahead.}  
3. {One last night scene - one of them stays behind after mopping.}

>> USER: Option 3 - Continue mopping. I grumble. I wanted to use my fruit to just move the juice into the bucket, but I think it's been sun baked so long that it no longer qualifies as juice anymore...

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Courtyard - Midnight, Just Us and the Mop]**  
**Scene: "After the Mess, What Remains"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Warm | Mood: Quiet Companionship, Shared Burdens, Something Brewing**

---

The sound of sloshing water echoes gently through the courtyard, punctuated by the rhythmic squeak of three mops being dragged over various patches of former fruit-based elemental residue.

You grunt as you lean harder into one particularly stubborn, sugar-caramelized splotch of kiwi concentrate near a shattered column base.

> "Ugh. I *wanted* to use my fruit..."

You pause, wipe your brow with the back of your sleeve, and jab the mop again.

> "Just move the juice into the bucket, right? Easy."

> "But noooo. This stuff's been sunbaked so long I think it qualifies as *construction material* now."

---

**A chuckle breaks the silence.**

You glance up-

**Vivi's gone.**

At some point, she must've quietly excused herself, likely summoned by a late-night matter of state.

But someone stayed.

And it's the one with better mop form.

**Tashigi.**

Still there, sleeves rolled, boots off to the side, standing barefoot on the cooling stones like it's nothing.

---

She raises an eyebrow at your predicament.

> "You *sure* you're a Devil Fruit user?"

---

You grunt again, this time with the *long-suffering theatricality* only teachers and jan</pre>
