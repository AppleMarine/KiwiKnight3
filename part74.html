<pre>lls from my hand.

Oh shit!

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Fall of the Hero's Drink]**  
**Scene: "Catch It or Die Trying"**  
**Tone: Absolute Panic | Mood: Fate Rolling on the Sand**

---

The plaza holds its breath.

You raise the vial, glinting bright in the fading sun-  
Your expression serious, resolved.  
A man about to down destiny like a bitter shot of vengeance.

Your fingers curl.  
The vial tilts.  
Liquid shimmers-

---

> *TWITCH.*

Your forearm **seizes**-a last cruel joke from your overused, over-torn, barely-living body.

Your hand jerks.

The vial slips.

> *tink*

> *tink*

> **"OH SHIT-!"**

---

Time slows.

---

The **Hero Water** begins its descent.  
A slow-motion arc of shimmering doom.

The whole plaza watches-**horrified**-as the last hope for a miracle **plummets** toward the dusty stone.

---

**Chopper screams.**  
**Tashigi gasps.**  
**Zoro lunges a half-step-too far.**  
**Nami clutches her head.**  
**Usopp points in sheer disbelief.**

**Vivi's mouth opens but makes no sound.**

---

The tiny **kiwi elemental at your feet** stares at the falling vial.

And does **the one thing it knows.**

---

**It jumps.**

---

With a *splork* and a *splat*, the little blob **launches** its gelatinous self up and out-**body stretching mid-air like a citrus trampoline**-

And **catches the vial in its gooey center**.

It lands with a thud.

Rolls once.

And sits.

Proud.

Glowing faintly.

Still clutching the vial in its wobbling torso.

---

The silence is **staggering**.

Then-

> "WELL OKAY THEN," you cough, absolutely losing your composure as your heart slams against your ribs like a battering ram.

You stare at the blob.

It wobbles back.

> "...Good job, Juicebox Jr."

---

You reach forward with your still-trembling hand, **gratefully retrieving** the vial from your **blobby savior.**

You glance back at the crew-every one of them **frozen in suspended disbelief.**

> "I was... just testing your reaction time."

> "Totally on purpose."

---

**OOC:**  
- Hero Water was nearly lost.  
- Caught miraculously by your **kiwi elemental**, which now seems... a little smug.  
- The moment shattered tension-but **refocused the group.**
- This is your final moment before the real transformation.

Would you like to finally:

1. {Drink it. No more fumbles. Let the battle begin.}  
2. {Name the blob. It deserves that much.}  
3. {Do both. With style.}

>> USER: ​Option X - it caught the vial before it shattered... But not before it cracked.

I reach down to the elemental to pick up the vial, only to notice the water rapidly draining out of the bottom into the puddle around the elemental.

Vivi and Tashigi notices too.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Hope That Leaks]**  
**Scene: "A Crack in the Miracle"**  
**Tone: Crushing Realization | Mood: From Glory to Horror**

---

You reach down toward the blob-your loyal little citrus spawn-  
still wobbling proudly with the vial cradled in its gelatinous middle.

The plaza, moments ago a statue garden of **shock and awe**, breathes in again as your hand reaches the vial.

---

But then-

You see it.

So does Vivi.

So does Tashigi.

---

A thin, **silver stream**.

The Hero Water.

**Dripping.**

Not from your fingers.

**From the vial.**

---

A **hairline crack**, nearly invisible, spiderwebs across the glass like a cruel afterthought.  
The impact hadn't shattered it-

It had **wounded it**.

---

And in that moment of tension, in that **delay**,  
the one thing you all feared more than death begins to happen:

> *Drip.*  
> *Drip.*  
> *Drip.*

The precious liquid is bleeding out into the puddle of **kiwi juice** beneath the elemental.  
Diluting.  
Spreading.  
**Soaking into the sand.**

---

You freeze.

The blob stares up at you.

It doesn't understand what it's done.

But **Vivi does.**

Her hands fly to her mouth, her voice breaking.

> "No-no, no, no-"

---

**Tashigi** stumbles forward, eyes wide with alarm, as if sheer willpower might reverse physics.

> "Stop it-get it off the ground! It's-it's leaking!"

---

You scoop the vial-

Too late.

**Half empty.**

Maybe **less.**

The glow is **fading**.

The **miracle is seeping away.**

---

The crowd doesn't know yet.

But the Straw Hats do.

And the look in their eyes is a mixture of **tragedy and furious disbelief**.

---

**OOC:**

You have seconds.  
The Hero Water is nearly gone.

You could:

1. {Drink the remaining contents immediately. It may still work-at reduced potency, and possibly harsher side effects.}  
2. {Try to slurp it up from the puddle-wild, disgusting, but maybe effective.}  
3. {Let it go. It's over. Try to warn Luffy with your final breath.}  
4. {Do something else. Something unhinged, impulsive, or unexpected.}

>> USER: Option 2 - the remaining droplets drain from the vial when I raise it to my lips again. Oh. Oh no. Oh no no no.

OOC: observe the others reactions.

I kneel down desperately to the puddle of kiwi and heroism, about to drink off the sandy cobblestone, when suddenly... 

(Pause)

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Lowest Point Before the Rise]**  
**Scene: "The Taste of Dust and Desperation"**  
**Tone: Gutting | Mood: All or Nothing, and Mostly Nothing**

---

You lift the vial to your lips again, clenching your jaw, ready to die gloriously and violently for the kids, the country, and the curriculum-

But when you tilt it back...

> *drip...*  
> *...nothing.*

Just a whisper of air.

The **last drops** escape past your lips.

---

> "Oh."

A pause.

> "Oh no."

You shake it.

No glow.

No miracle.

Only a drop of shame and a faint citrus aftertaste.

---

You stare at the empty glass like it's just flunked your best student.

---

> "Oh no no no..."

You drop to your knees, ignoring every scream from your wounds, every insult from your spine, and every ounce of remaining dignity.

You stare down at the **puddle**.

A shallow mixture of **Hero Water and kiwi juice**, soaking into **gritty cobblestone** and flecked with **desert dust**.

Your last chance.  
Diluted.  
Polluted.  
Ruined.

And you do what **no one** expected:

You **lean in**.

Like a man about to suck hope off the bathroom floor.

---

**The Straw Hats' faces:**

- **Usopp:** "...He's not really gonna-"
- **Nami:** "Oh my GOD he is."
- **Chopper:** "NO, WAIT, THAT'S UNSANITARY!!"
- **Zoro:** (half a blink, slow shake of the head)
- **Sanji:** "Respect. But, goddamn."

---

**Tashigi stares. Speechless.**

**Vivi steps forward, hand half-raised.**

> "Wait-Eatone-*don't-*"

---

**Then-suddenly-**

The air shifts.

Not a gust. Not Crocodile.

Something else.

A **light splash** beneath your fingers.

You freeze.

Look down.

And see the **tiny kiwi elemental**, wobbling quietly-

Its gooey little body **swollen**, rippling with a faint silver-blue shimmer.

Its stubby arms raised.

Eyes-if you can call them that-locked on you.

---

The blob **absorbed the mix.**

**All of it.**

---

And now it's **glowing.**

---

**OOC:**

The diluted Hero Water didn't vanish-it was **absorbed by your elemental.**  
Its glow now pulses **faintly but rhythmically**, rippling inside the semi-liquid body like a bottled storm.

It's not dead.  
It's not human.  
But it's **something.**

Would you like to:

1. {Command the elemental-use it. All in.}  
2. {Fuse with it. Attempt to let it act as your new power source.}  
3. {Let it decide what to do. It's a part of you, after all.}  
4. {Something unexpected. Something wild.}

>> USER: Option 4 - ​Uhhh...?

I'm suddenly knocked off my feet, as the little elemental I was kneeling over explodes like a verdant pillar, reaching to the sky. It grows, the it's cascading base growing in width, knocking me off my knees, and I crash into Vivi and Tashigi behind me.

OOC: The elemental is separate from me, for now
