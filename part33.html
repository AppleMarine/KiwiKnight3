<pre>e explodes outward**, growing like a living, viscous lake.  
It glows faintly green, thickening at the edges, **slick but stabilizing**, congealing into a **cushioned disc** wide enough for everyone.

Your shoes begin to slide.  
The air smells like **fruit panic and ozone**.

---

The crew piles in:

- Zoro grunts, steadying Luffy and himself as he plants his boots.  
- Nami crouches, one arm around Chopper, the other grabbing Vivi.  
- Tashigi stands at the edge-sword ready-**facing the incoming tunnel.**

She looks back.

> "You good?"

> "No. But I've got **tenured panic training.**"

---

From the tunnel:  
The sand *whispers*.  
The air gets *hotter*.  
You hear **footsteps. Slow. Measured. Death on a coffee break.**

> **Crocodile.**

---

**üìù Tactical State:**

- Everyone is now on the **evac puddle.**  
- Juice surge: Fully powered.  
- Crocodile: **Seconds away** from visual.  
- Smoker: Still imprisoned, elsewhere.  
- Option to launch **juice-slide evacuation** is **ready now.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Trigger the puddle. Launch the whole group up the waterfall in a high-pressure escape wave.}  
2. {Delay for two more seconds. If Crocodile gets close enough, blind him with a ceiling trap before you go.}  
3. {Yell to Tashigi-"Come on, now!" Pull her onto the puddle and **evac everyone, immediately.**}  
4. {Lock eyes with Crocodile as he enters. "Sorry. Vacation's over." THEN launch.}  
5. {Give the Straw Hats a push. Send them first. You and Tashigi stay to cover the retreat.}

üåÄ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 3 - what are you going to do with a sword? Get in here! Pull Tashigi by the shoulder into the disc of juice, and then have it erupt like a reverse waterfall, an emerald elevator.

I can swim through it easily. Focus on pushing the others up.

>> ASSISTANT: **üé≤ Option 3 Selected - "This Ain't a Swordfight, It's a Slip ‚Äòn Save."**  
**Tone: Urgent Protection | Action: Full-Team Citrus Evacuation with Tactical Teacher-Lunging**  
**üé≤ Rescue Pull Roll - (Eatone +2 Strength, +1 Reflexes, +1 Bond with Tashigi) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**üé≤ Juice Control: Reverse Waterfall Execution - (Eatone +2 Devil Fruit Mastery, +2 Emergency Pushing) = Result: 8 [Legendary]**  
**üé≤ Crocodile's Perception - (+2 Awareness, -1 Tunnel Distance, -2 Emotional Investment in Monologue Timing) = Result: 1 [Poor]**  
**‚úÖ Outcome: You pull Tashigi in *just in time*. The platform erupts in a blinding emerald geyser. You swim like Poseidon with a lesson plan. Everyone launches. Crocodile arrives **just** late enough to eat pulp and rage.**

---

> "What are you going to do with a *sword*?! This isn't a duel-it's a damn *evac drill!*"

Tashigi's lips part in protest-but you don't wait.

> You **grab her shoulder** and yank.

She lands with a thud on the **thick disc of juice**, and you slam your palm downward again-

> "EVERYONE HOLD ON!"

---

The puddle **explodes**.

Not up-not like a geyser.

> **Like a reverse waterfall,** funneled and focused, a **vertical emerald elevator** wrapped in spinning rings of juice, pressure-locked into a spiraling chute.

You dive into it as it forms, legs sliding upward, arms thrusting down-

> *swimming against your own power*, legs kicking like a torpedo as you push the others upward-

- **Zoro** braces Luffy on his back, half-surfing the juice surge.
- **Nami shrieks**, gripping Chopper and Vivi as they rocket up the stream.
- **Tashigi** lands in a crouch beside you-then steadies herself and helps brace the lift's walls from within.
- **You** push from below, teeth grit, body half-dissolved in fruit force.

> *The whole world tilts into green and roar.*

---

**Behind you-just as the last of your boot clears the platform:**

> **Crocodile emerges.**

Coat billowing. Hook gleaming.

He sees only the **tail end of a fruit-powered miracle**, the last trace of an emerald flash-

> **and the slap of a puddle in his face.**

He stands there, blinking fruit acid out of his eyes as the ceiling traps **burst**, raining citrus shrapnel into his freshly shaved villain ego.

> "...What the-"

---

You all **erupt into the hallway above**, landing in a heap of bodies, steam, and pulp.

- **Luffy rolls off Zoro's back, groaning.**
- **Nami coughs, soaked but whole.**
- **Chopper shakes juice out of his fur.**
- **Vivi just breathes.**
- **Tashigi collapses into a half-sitting crouch, sword across her lap.**

And you?

> You stumble forward, soak-dripping, lungs burning, pulse jackhammering.

Then straighten.

> "Okay. That was a *lot*."

---

**üìù Tactical Outcome:**

- Entire crew: **Successfully evacuated** to the floor above Rain Dinners' prison chamber.  
- Crocodile: **Arrived too late**. Furious. Soaked. Citrus-blinded.  
- You: **Exhausted**, but functioning. Juice reserves strained but active.  
- The battle below? No longer yours.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Find a door. Lock it. You need **time**.}  
2. {Collapse onto the floor and mutter "I hate summer vacation."}  
3. {Turn to Tashigi: "We need to get Smoker. That was the warm-up."}  
4. {Look to the Straw Hats. "Hey. Pirates. You owe me juice money."}  
5. {Immediately prep another exit path-this isn't over yet. Crocodile's still hunting.}

üåÄ {Choose your action..}

>> USER: Flood the vent with juice, hopefully slow him down (unlikely). I point at Tashigi. Get them up and go! I'll cover you!

>> ASSISTANT: **üé≤ Action Selected - "Covering Fire, Citrus Style."**  
**Tone: Heroic Desperation with a Pulp Payload**  
**üé≤ Juice Flood Roll - (Eatone +2 Control, +1 Environmental Use, +1 Emotional Surge) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**üé≤ Crocodile Resistance - (+2 Logia Defense, -2 Surprise, -1 Acid Burn Pissing Him Off) = Result: 1 [Poor]**  
**üé≤ Tashigi's Command Response - (+2 Leadership, +1 Trust in You) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**‚úÖ Outcome: You flood the vent hard. The backpressure **douses the tunnel** in acidic, traction-killing citrus sludge. Crocodile is **momentarily blinded and enraged.** Tashigi takes the order-**and leads the crew out.** You're now the **last line.**

---

Your legs are trembling. Your arms sting. The citrus in your veins feels *used*, but your mind burns with one command:

> "Flood the damn tunnel."

You throw your arms toward the **vent you just blasted out of**, and **with the force of a firehose**, you unleash the last of your **pressurized kiwi reservoir**.

The green tide **roars back down** the vent, flooding the metal chute, **sloshing over broken trap triggers and walls**, and finally **splashes out at Crocodile's feet like a tropical tidal wave.**

> *SSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHK-*

The juice **hits him square in the face**-again.  
And this time? You hear it. The **sizzle** of citrus meeting sand.  
The hiss of *ego damage*.  
The growl of **humiliation**.

> "-WHO IS DOING THIS?!"

His voice booms up the shaft, thunderous and drenched.

---

You spin and jab a finger at Tashigi.

> "GET THEM UP AND GO!  
I'LL COVER YOU!"

For a split second, she doesn't move.

Then she **snaps to it**.

> "Straw Hats! On your feet! Move now-north corridor!"

She grabs Vivi and helps Nami lift Luffy as Zoro staggers to his feet, nodding once at you.

> "Don't die, pineapple."

Chopper scampers, looking back with wet eyes.

Tashigi stops once at the hallway's bend and looks back.

> "We'll meet at the palace! Don't be stupid!"

Then they're **gone**-footsteps echoing down a stone hallway into **open Alabasta sun**.

---

You're alone.  
Juice dripping from your fingertips.  
A vent hissing with returning wrath.

> Crocodile is climbing.  
> And he is **pissed.**

---

**üìù Tactical Status:**

- Crew: **Escaping.** Tashigi is leading them out.  
- You: **Alone. Spent. Still dangerous.**  
- Crocodile: **Climbing up the flooded vent**, citrus-blinded, sand boiling.  
- Next move is **yours alone.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Set traps. Juice tripwires, slick floors, anything to stall him before he breaches</pre>
