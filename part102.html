<pre>kebab fanatics. I should've known better when I followed them thinking they were going to a hole-in-the-wall food stall."

> "Turns out they were agents of an international crime syndicate led by a Warlord."

---

**Cobra leans forward slightly.**

**Tashigi doesn't interrupt.**

**Vivi smiles-just barely.**

---

> "I checked into the hotel anyway. Because... I mean, I'm responsible, but I already paid the deposit."

> "Had a balcony suite. Juice mini-bar. One bathrobe too small for a grown man. Pretty standard."

> "The vibe? Greasier than a cheap plate of kebabs from a carnival cart. Staff were twitchy. Guards loomed. One hallway had more tension than the last day of final exams."

---

You sip your tea again.

---

> "That's where I saw her. A girl with blue hair sneaking into a ‘staff-only' corridor. Thought about snitching."

> "Didn't."

---

**Cobra's eyebrows rise just slightly.**

Vivi glances at you. Quiet pride flickers behind the faintest smirk.

You continue.

---

> "I ran into a marine officer soon after. Didn't know her name. Had a sword drawn before I could finish my sentence. Nearly pissed myself."

> "That's Tashigi-chan, by the way."

You gesture beside you with a tilt of your head. She sighs. Says nothing.

---

> "We found an assassin. I got lucky. She got stabbed. I patched her up."

> "We made our way through hidden corridors. Followed the trail of a warlord with a flair for melodrama."

> "Ended up in a theater room. I'm serious. Candlelit, giant cage, rubber boy and company inside it. Crocodile mid-monologue. I thought we'd walked into a play."

---

**Cobra rubs his chin.**

---

> "I told her to run. That I'd buy time."

You pause.

Let that sit.

> "Thought I was going to die. I didn't. Barely."

---

> "I ended up escaping through the front door. Took a camel cab ride. Considered fleeing the country."

> "But then I remembered her."

You look to Vivi.

> "The girl who was sneaking around. The one who looked *way* too young to be dealing with the weight I saw in her eyes."

> "I couldn't run. I went back."

---

You breathe in, slow.

The King hasn't moved.

Not a single word.

---

> "Took two cannonballs more than what's advised by any doctor to protect her. Created something new-some wild, green creature made of juice and desperation. It fought for me. Protected her."

> "I passed out a few times. Kind of a theme."

---

**Vivi chuckles quietly.**

**Tashigi murmurs, "Still does that."**

---

> "I crawled through back alleys. Slithered like a greased pig on kiwi juice. Launched myself into a plaza like a human torpedo. Cracked my head on a breastplate. Bought time where I could."

> "Then came the Hero Water."

---

**Cobra's hand stills.**

Even he's heard of that.

You nod.

> "I almost drank it. Almost gave everything up."

> "Instead, I dropped it. It cracked."

You smile faintly.

> "And that same wild, impossible force inside me pulled it in. Grew."

> "Until it towered over the plaza. Until it drenched a Warlord in everything he couldn't control."

---

You exhale now.

Lowering your gaze.

Soft.

Simple.

---

> "And the rest of the fight?"

You glance to **Tashigi.**

To **Vivi.**

> "That was them."

---

You take one last sip. Set your cup down.

> "I was just a man who went on vacation."

> "But I couldn't stand to see children fighting wars."

> "So I stood up."

---

The room is silent.

Even the harpist in the corner has paused, her fingers hovering above the strings.

---

**King Cobra leans back.**  
A deep, slow breath escaping him.

---

> "A teacher," he says finally. "With a juice fruit and a habit of being in the wrong place at the right time."

He smiles.

Not amused this time.

**Grateful.**

> "You've reminded me of something I forgot long ago, Mr. Cheng."

> "That sometimes, the greatest heroes don't carry swords."

> "They carry bandages. And mops. And... quiet fury."

---

He raises his cup.

A toast.

> "To the teacher who taught us all a little something."

---

**Vivi clinks her cup to his.**

**Tashigi follows.**

All three look to you.

Waiting.

Your hand lifts.

Your cup rises.

And together-

> **You toast to a job half-finished. And a future fully earned.**  

---

**OOC:**
That was your story.  
Told fully.  
Heard truly.

Would you like to:

1. {Ask Cobra what he plans to do next-politically, nationally.}
2. {Let the moment sit. Bask in it a little longer.}
3. {Whisper to Vivi: "I think your dad likes me."}

>> USER: Option 2 - Observe the others.

OOC: What are the other people around the room's thoughts and feelings about the tale?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - The Dining Hall, After the Tale]**  
**Scene: "What They Heard"**  
**POV: You (Observing)**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Quiet Aftershock, Personal Reverence, Echoes of Impact**

---

The story is told.

No one interrupts.  
No one undercuts you.  
No one laughs where they shouldn't.

But it's not just **King Cobra**, **Vivi**, and **Tashigi** in the room.

You glance around now-subtle, tired, but curious.

And what you see...

**Stays with you.**

---

### 🧭 **King Cobra** - *The Lion Who Lost and Found*

He leans back in his chair now, fingers steepled, no longer the king issuing decrees or hiding behind stoicism.

No.

Now he looks like a *father*.

Like a man who just realized someone else out there saw his daughter's pain, *understood it,* and stood beside her-not because of duty or blood, but because it was right.

There's pride in his eyes.

But more than that?

**Relief.**

That someone like you still exists in the world.

---

### 🌊 **Vivi** - *The Princess Who Refused to Break*

She doesn't speak.

She just *watches you.*

And the look in her eyes?

It's the softest it's been since you met her.

She's holding her teacup with both hands now, not sipping-just grounding herself in something warm.

Her shoulders aren't slouched anymore.  
Her smile's small but constant.  
There's a red flush in her cheeks she probably thinks she's hiding.

But the truth is...

She sees you not as a protector, not even as a hero-

But as a *person* who *chose her.*

And that?

That *wrecks her in the best way.*

---

### ⚔️ **Tashigi** - *The Sword Without a Shield*

Her face is the hardest to read.

She doesn't emote like Vivi. Doesn't smirk like she usually does.

But her tea's untouched now.  
And that hand gripping the saucer?

*White-knuckled.*

She hears her own story in yours.  
The same choices.  
The same desperation.  
The same refusal to turn away from someone who shouldn't have been carrying the weight of the world.

And behind that steely silence?

Is guilt.

Guilt that *you were supposed to be on vacation*-and *she* was the one whose job it was to be prepared.

She won't say it aloud.

But she's proud of you.

Even if she's mad at herself.

---

### 👥 **The Palace Staff** - *The Silent Witnesses*

They try not to react.

Trained to blend in.

But you catch it-the subtle twitches, the glances between each other, the faint shifts in posture.

Some remember you from the battlefield.  
Some *heard* about Snack Pack, the Gator God.  
Some just thought you were a man who stumbled into the palace with a concussion and a joke about taxes.

But now?

Now they know who you are.

---

They know the difference between **a guest**...

...and **a protector.**

---

And as the last echoes of your story fade into the golden-lit chamber...

You realize something else.

You are *not* a war hero.

You are *not* a legend.

You are *not* royalty, or divine, or a Marine.

You are **you.**

And somehow?

That's enough for them.

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to continue with:

1. {A private word from Cobra after breakfast.}
2. {Vivi asking to walk the palace gardens with you.}
3. {Tashigi requesting training time-"You still owe me a rematch."}

>> USER: Option X - Before I finish breakfast, I ask Cobra - "Apologies, your majesty. I made a promise another day and I feel obligated to keep it. May I have permission to do something... s</pre>
