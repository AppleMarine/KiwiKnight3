<pre>at least... jiggles in a vaguely affirmative way.

You slip through the side street and step into the **Marine Field Office**, a building still half-under renovation. Scaffolding clings to its southern wall, and a contractor is grumbling at a collapsed filing shelf inside. But despite the mess, the core of the office is intact: maps, mission boards, a Den Den Mushi wall, and desks of overworked, **tired** Marines and local liaisons.

---

The woman at the front desk raises an eyebrow as you walk in, your coat still damp from elemental drippings.

> "Can I... help you, sir?"

Her tone is neutral. Professional. Just a hint of the "please don't track fruit slime across my newly mopped floors" undertone.

**OOC: You are now inside the Marine Outpost.**

This location includes:
- Access to **incident logs, bounty records**, and **current deployments**
- **Communication lines** (heavily regulated)
- A growing bulletin board of **community roles and public service notices**
- A few Marines who likely **recognize you**... maybe even from the paper.

---

**You have the floor.**

Would you like to:

1. {Ask about bounty logistics-if Crocodile's bounty is eligible, and if *you* are due a cut.}  
2. {Inquire about joining Alabasta's civilian defense corps officially-now that you've sort of... become one.}  
3. {Look for Smoker-if he's been using this office as a base.}  
4. {Something else entirely. Your call, Sensei.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - So... Do you know how collecting bounties on ex-warlords work? Assuming I'm eligible, at all.

Thinking: Technically I wasn't really fighting him directly, my elemental did. And even then, my elemental was only in a supporting role. Plus Crocodile was fighting a marine and pirate simultaneously. Does it become void since it became a marine operation? Because it could've been considered just pirate on pirate action?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Marine Field Office, Administrative Desk]**  
**Scene: "Bounty Bureaucracy"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Casual Inquiry Meets Legal Confusion | Mood: Mildly Chaotic, Surprisingly Intricate**

---

You lean an elbow on the polished (and recently juice-free) front counter.  
Your coat still smells faintly of kiwi.  
Your back still aches from earlier *heroism*.  
But this? This is the *true* test of a warrior's spirit.

**Paperwork.**

---

> "So..." you begin, keeping your tone level, charming, casual.  
> "How does one go about collecting a bounty on an ex-Warlord?"

The marine clerk doesn't look up yet-she's writing something that involves a lot of angry underlines.

> "Are you asking for legal or ethical reasons?"

You cough.

> "Uh. Financial?"

---

She sighs, then finally looks up and adjusts her glasses.

> "That's a complicated one."

She opens a drawer and pulls out a thick, coffee-stained folder labeled: **BOUNTY ELIGIBILITY DISPUTES: POST-WARLORD STATUS**  
Inside? You see *dozens* of case summaries, cross-claims, and handwritten addendums marked **PENDING**.

---

> "Okay," she begins, in a tone that says *you're going to regret asking*,  
> "Bounty eligibility on revoked Warlords depends on several factors:"

---

She ticks off her fingers:

**"One."**  
> "Did the individual have a government-issued bounty prior to, or after, their Warlord status was revoked?"

**"Two."**  
> "Were they apprehended or defeated in a recognized anti-criminal operation?"  
> "If Marines were involved, claims often default to Marine oversight."

**"Three."**  
> "Was the contribution to the defeat **measurable, significant, and direct**?"

She gives you a once-over, eyes lingering on the juice stains on your coat.

> "You look like you did something weird. So maybe."

---

You raise a tentative hand.

> "Uh... what if it was more like..."

> "...A *giant fruit elemental* did most of the heavy lifting while I lay unconscious in a public square?"

She pauses. Pen hovers mid-air.

> "...Like a summoned creature?"

You nod.

She scribbles something.

> "*Possible 'Proxy Combatant Clause' Invocation.*"

---

> "Also," you add, "he was also being punched by a pirate and fisted by a marine at the time. Like, simultaneously."

She doesn't even blink.

> "Then you'll want subsection 4.3: *‘Shared Contribution in Mixed Criminal-Justice Action Events.'*"

---

You blink.

> "...Does that cancel the bounty?"

She shrugs.

> "Not always. Sometimes it just *splits* it."

> "If Smoker files a claim, it becomes Marine property. If Straw Hat Luffy files one, it might be rejected since he's a pirate. If **neither** files, and you get there first..."

She raises an eyebrow.

> "Well. You *might* get a cut."

---

> "How much of a cut?"

She slams down a stack of fine print marked:  
**‘UP TO X BERRI' DOES NOT GUARANTEE X BERRI'**

> "Ever hear of *processing fees, maritime deduction taxes,* and *payout delay clauses*?"

---

You slowly step back from the counter.

She pats the folder.

> "But hey. If you really want to file... we can start your paperwork now."

> "Estimated processing time is..."  
She flips a page.

> "...14 to 18 months. Assuming you survive the first audit."

---

**OOC:**
You now understand that collecting on **Crocodile's bounty** is:

- *Technically possible*
- *Incredibly bureaucratic*
- *Likely to be contested*
- *May end in you receiving a novelty check for 7,000 Berri and a coupon for a free government-issue protein bar*

Would you like to:

1. {File the bounty claim anyway. It's the principle of the thing.}  
2. {Decline to file, and maybe try to cash in some palace goodwill later instead.}  
3. {Ask about registering your fruit officially with the World Government (a risky move).}  
4. {Ask to see Smoker, if he's present.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - ...can I see how much paperwork is involved first?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Marine Field Office - Administrative Abyss]**  
**Scene: "The Filing Gauntlet"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Slow-Motion Horror | Mood: Bureaucratic Nightmare with Citrus Undertones**

---

The clerk narrows her eyes, lips quirking into something between amusement and pity.

> "You sure?"

You pause.

Then-like a man about to open **Pandora's Filing Cabinet**-you nod solemnly.

> "Just... show me how much paperwork we're talking about."

---

She reaches beneath the desk, opens a deep drawer, and with the dramatic flair of someone who's seen *too many idealists perish at the hands of bureaucracy*, pulls out a **stack of forms**.

Not one folder.

Not two.

**Six.**

Each a different color.  
Each bearing a different set of seals, acronyms, and terrifyingly vague footnotes.

---

She slaps them down, one by one:

---

1. **Form W-BT-004** - *Revocation Adjustment Confirmation*  
> "Verifies that the bounty remained active during revocation transition."

2. **Form M-JT-872** - *Marine Joint Engagement Clause*  
> "Outlines how many Marines were present, their contributions, and why they didn't get the kill first."

3. **Form C-XP-666** - *Civilian Proxy Combatant Declaration*  
> "You sign this, you declare yourself ‘primarily responsible' for any and all juice-related damages in a 10-mile radius."

4. **Form P-KI-399** - *Paramecia-Based Summon Proxy Filing*  
> "Covers entities born of fruit-based consciousness that act on the user's behalf."  
> (Scrawled on the top: *DOES NOT APPLY TO WHIPPED CREAM OR JAM-TYPE ABILITIES*)

5. **Form B-REV-404** - *Bounty Revenue Share Petition*  
> "Used to request payment from multiple parties' shared defeat. Must include *witness testimony,* medical reports, and fruit residue samples."

6. **Form X-VOID-UNL** - *World Government Exception Liability Waiver*  
> "In case the claim is rejected and you want to avoid being fined for impersonating a bounty hunter with insufficient credentials."

---

She finishes the display with a flourish.

Then slowly pushes a pen across the desk.

> "Page count comes to around... two hundred and seventy-six. Including appendices."

> "Ink not included."

You stare at it.
