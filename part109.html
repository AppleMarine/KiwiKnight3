**Tashigi groans.**  
**The vendor offers Kiwi-Kop a fig.**  
**Kiwi-Kop accepts it by absorbing it into its face.**

---

Despite yourself, you're smiling.

This?  
This is *you now*.  
Not perfect.  
Not polished.  
But *present.*

And dammit-

**Even if your justice leaks citrus, it still shows up.**

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Spend the afternoon testing the Kiwi Elemental's limits-with or without Tashigi's help.}  
2. {Receive a summons: Vivi has requested your presence for a meeting.}  
3. {Split up temporarily: Tashigi to patrol, you to explore your fruit power in peace.}

>> USER: Option 1 - Do I need to follow an elemental around with a doggy bag and a mop so it doesn't create a slipping hazard everywhere it goes?
I scratch my chin as I continue walking.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Outer City, Citrus Patrol Begins]**  
**Scene: "The Mop and the Myth"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Experimental | Mood: Hilarious Chaos, Discovery, Subtle Growth**

---

You scratch your chin thoughtfully as you watch your glorious citrus spawn **dribble its way down the street like a half-melted parade float**.

**Kiwi-Kop** pauses occasionally to pivot toward barking dogs, shady alleyways, or unattended bread carts with the majestic vigilance of a proud yet *extremely moist* public servant.

You squint.

> "Do I need to follow an elemental around with a mop and a bucket to make sure it's not creating slipping hazards everywhere?"

You take a slow step forward.

**Squish.**

You look down.

> "...Shit."

---

**Tashigi** doesn't even try to hide the smirk this time.

> "You're going to cause a lawsuit before lunch."

She pulls a clean cloth from her pocket and flings it at you with expert one-handed precision.

> "Here. You mop. I'll supervise."

---

You bend over with a groan and **start mopping behind your own sentient juice creation**, which continues waddling confidently toward a back alley with all the purpose of an officer on his beat-and all the **disaster potential of an overripe melon.**

---

Still, as you tail it, your teacher-brain kicks in:

You start taking notes.  
Mental ones.  
Maybe even literal ones in the back of your notebook later.

---

### Observed Kiwi Elemental Behaviors:

- **Autonomous mobility** (very slow)  
- **Basic threat detection** (suspiciously interested in cats, though)  
- **Selective stickiness** (fig pieces cling to it; sand grains do not)  
- **Personality variance** based on juice type-this one? Sweet and polite.  
- **Communication**: Emits a low "bloop" when happy. May also be a warning sign.

---

At one point, Kiwi-Kop lifts one stubby arm and **points at a shady figure loitering near an alleyway fruit stall.**

Tashigi's brow rises.

> "...Was that a gesture?"

You nod slowly.

> "I think so."

Tashigi tightens her coat, already stepping toward the alley.

> "You're telling me that blob just detected a thief before I did?"

> "*You* trained it?"

You put your hands on your hips proudly, baton hanging lazily at your side.

> "Nope. I parented it."

---

Tashigi glares at you, then mutters under her breath.

> "I've fought Warlords. I've fought sea monsters. And *this* is what breaks me."

---

The shady figure notices the attention-starts to bolt.

> "Hey!"

Tashigi **takes off like a bullet.** You follow, your **Kiwi-Kop** waddling behind with what might be a heroic squeaky bloop of support.

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Split off from Tashigi and try to flank the runner with juice tricks.}  
2. {Send Kiwi-Kop to cut the alley and intercept. Might be risky.}  
3. {Stick with Tashigi and back her up-old-fashioned style.}

>> USER: Option 1 / 3. Watch Tashigi's back, but send Kiwi Kop to flank. Secrete more juice until Kiwi Kop is about 4 feet high.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Back Alley Pursuit]**  
**Scene: "The Juice Division"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Tactical, Absurdly So | Mood: Fast-Paced, Trust-Forged, Just the Right Amount of Ridiculous**

---

**The suspect bolts**-a flash of cloth, sand-hardened boots pounding against the cobblestones, slicing through narrow gaps between buildings like he's done it before.

**Tashigi's already moving**, her long coat snapping like a banner behind her, sword bouncing lightly against her hip as she charges in full stride.

---

But you?

You peel off sideways.  
Trust in her sword.  
And trust in something far newer, far gooier.

> "Go, Kiwi-Kop. Earn that badge!"

---

You slam your palm to the alley wall.

*BWOOMPF.*

A heavy pulse of emerald liquid bursts from your skin, curling up and around the original **Kiwi-Kop**, feeding into its body in surging, syrup-thick waves. It grows rapidly-**four feet high now**, its arms broadening, its vaguely defined jawline **somehow more heroic.**

A fig seed clinks off its forehead.

> "Bloop," it grunts, with newfound gravitas.

---

The suspect glances back-

-sees **Tashigi closing in, blade not yet drawn, but *low and ready***-

-then cuts right, aiming to lose her down a narrower pass between two stalls.

**Right where you sent your new recruit.**

---

**Kiwi-Kop barrels around the corner.**  
Not fast.  
But *present.*

Sticky footsteps echo like squelching doom.

---

The thief slows.

Then skids to a halt.

> "What the hell is-"

He plants a foot to change direction-  
**BAD MOVE.**

The cobbles glisten.

Too late.

> *SCHLIP*

The runner's foot flies out from under him-  
He spins-  
**Falls. HARD.**

Right into a puddle of *civic-minded citrus.*

---

You approach just as Tashigi rounds the alley, breathing hard, sword still sheathed.

> "Got eyes on?"

You give her a casual salute with the mop you're still inexplicably carrying.

> "Suspect apprehended by Officer Kop."

---

She looks past you at the would-be thief-**now groaning on the ground, half-covered in kiwi goo and shame.**

She stares at him.  
Then you.  
Then Kiwi-Kop, who has taken a proud stance on the thief's back like a marshmallow knight conquering a sandbag.

---

> "...Okay," she mutters.

> "I'll admit it."

> "That was almost cool."

---

**OOC:**
You've now confirmed:
- Kiwi Elementals can be **grown, directed**, and used for limited **non-lethal pursuit/intervention.**
- They cause **environmental hazards**. Which you might *absolutely* get fined for later.
- They respond to emotional intent and possibly the thickness/sweetness of your output.
- Tashigi is starting to see them as **functional. Maybe even useful.**

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Interrogate the suspect. Could be Baroque, or just petty crime.}  
2. {Let Tashigi handle the questioning while you debrief Kiwi-Kop.}  
3. {Head back to the palace-Vivi has sent word. There's a civil council meeting forming.}

>> USER: Option 2 - I spot a nearby Marine office. Hey Tashigi-chan. You got him covered? I've got something to take care of in the office, I'll be right back.

I keep Kiwi Kop to watch Tashigi's back, in an autonomous protection mode. I pray that it's smart enough to distinguish friend from foe, though.

OOC: Give me a window to begin the office scene.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Local Marine Field Office, East Wing]**  
**Scene: "Paperwork and Purpose"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Shift to Serious | Mood: Focused, Curious, Foundations Being Set**

---

**"You got him covered?"**  
You toss the words to Tashigi with an easy tone, but there's a flicker of real meaning beneath them. Trust. Confidence. Shared rhythm.

She gives you a sharp nod without even looking your way, already crouching near the suspect, her sword now drawn-not to threaten, but to *remind*.

> "He twitches, I break a kneecap. Take your time."

---

**Kiwi-Kop lingers behind.**

Now a respectable 4-foot-tall pillar of semi-solid heroism, its stubby arms cross over its vague chest region. It emits a long, drawn-out "bloop..." like a dog scanning for squirrels.

You murmur to it on your way out:

> "Protect mode. Prioritize Tashigi. No zapping fruit vendors. Please."

It nods.
