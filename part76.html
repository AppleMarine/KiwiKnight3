<body>
<pre>ed Kiwi Titan-**it's still you.**  
Still connected.

Still running on the last dregs of **your willpower**.

And if you **go out**, it might too.

---

> "Not yet... can't... sleep now..."

You press your palms into the warm, juice-slick cobblestone, trying to ground yourself-literally and figuratively. The sand grits into your scraped skin.

A slow, **metallic throbbing** pulses at the back of your skull.

The **concussion** is back in full force.  

Every heartbeat feels like a drum being played by a vengeful taiko demon.

---

Above, you hear the elemental roar again-**fist connecting with sand**, its weight shaking the palace rooftop. Luffy's voice cuts through, hoarse and furious.

> "Take this, bastard!!"

---

But your eyelids are slipping.

The corners of your vision begin to close in, **tunneling into shadows**.

> *No. Not yet. Not yet.*

---

You feel a touch.

Two, actually.

**Vivi's hand on your chest.**

**Tashigi's at your wrist.**

---

Vivi's voice is soft but full of rising panic.

> "He's crashing. He's crashing-Tashigi, what do we do?!"

**Tashigi's hand clenches.** Her jaw is tight.

> "He's still connected to that thing... if he passes out, we might lose our only edge."

She leans close-sweat-streaked, bloodied, but focused.

> "Eatone. *Sensei.* Stay with us."

> "You started this lesson. You *finish* it."

---

You blink.  
Barely.

You try to respond. Your mouth forms syllables that might be words, might be fruit-related nonsense.

---

Vivi moves closer, placing both hands on your cheeks, eyes wide and glistening.

> "You're not allowed to die like this. Not until we've won."

---

Above, a **sand spear slices through the elemental's arm**. It reforms-slower this time. Your breathing falters.

The connection is growing thin.

---

**OOC:**

You're holding on-barely.  
Your consciousness is the **thread** keeping the Kiwi Elemental fighting.

Would you like to:

1. {Say something to keep yourself anchored-to Vivi, Tashigi, or the crew.}  
2. {Push through with a desperate fruit technique-transfer control? Boost the elemental?}  
3. {Try to rally the elemental with emotion-through memory, conviction, or will.}

**Scene: "The Things We Die Thinking About"**  
**Tone: Tragicomedy | Mood: Barely Clinging to the World**  

---

Your body's a **wreck**.  
Your skull feels like it's been used to cork a cannon.  
The world around you blurs into bright streaks of battle and the warm smother of concerned hands.

---

You try to say something meaningful.  
Heroic. Impactful. Maybe something Luffy would yell from a rooftop.

But your **mouth**-your **teacher's soul**-has other plans.

---

> "...didn't even finish..."

Your lips move against Vivi's trembling hands.  
Your voice is barely a whisper, like sand pouring through torn parchment.

> "...the form for the... income declaration..."

A wheeze.

> "...owe the Treasury like... thirty thousand beri..."

A faint choke. You try to swallow, but you mostly taste dust and kiwi.

> "...I think I counted the bounty money *twice*..."

---

**Vivi stares.**

**Tashigi blinks.**

**Zoro slowly turns his head.**

> "Did he just say-"

**Sanji:** "Yeah."

**Usopp:** "He's dying... and he's thinking about his *taxes.*"

---

**Nami:**

She clutches her head.

> "That's it. He's officially one of us."

---

Above, the **elemental's core flickers**-but pulses stronger.  
Almost like it heard the muttered bureaucratic regret of its creator...

And it **roars. Again. Louder.**  
Kiwi energy flares. **Crocodile reels**.

---

Tashigi leans in again, voice low, biting back a laugh and a sob.

> "You're not allowed to die while owing back taxes, Sensei."

> "You're *staying awake*, and *you're paying those goddamn fees*-got it?"

---

Your eyelids flutter.

You grunt softly. Somewhere between a whimper and a citrus-flavored curse.

---

**OOC:**

You're right on the edge, teacher.

Your brain is clearly **running on fumes**, but your **connection to the elemental strengthens briefly**-as if even your subconscious refuses to let this be your last thought.

Would you like to:

1. {Attempt to speak again. Force yourself back with another thought, ridiculous or real.}  
2. {Let your body stay still, but mentally guide the elemental one last time.}  
3. {Give the floor to the elemental-it may now act on instinct. Its instinct is... yours.}

>> USER: ​Option X - my consciousness starts fading away.

The elemental slows down a touch.

**Tone: Quiet Dread | Mood: Fragile, Fading Connection**  

---

Your eyes flutter.

The pressure behind them is a thundering drumbeat now.  
Your chest rises once. Slowly.  
Then again-shallower.  

Your blood feels **thin**, and your breath tastes like citrus and dust.

You feel like you're **sinking into your own body**.

The world spins.

---

Your thoughts fracture-fleeting shards of memory and sensation.

- **A school bell ringing.**  
- **Juice boxes being passed around.**  
- **A student asking if Devil Fruits count as "vegetables."**  
- **You, correcting the spelling of ‘homicide' on a bounty form.**  
- **A voice saying: "Don't die, Sensei."**

---

**The lights begin to dim.**

---

Up on the palace roof, the **Kiwi Elemental's** pace begins to **slow.**

Its movements-once thunderous, now **lagging**, deliberate.  
Its glowing veins pulse-sluggish.  
One fist misses its mark by inches.  
**Crocodile slips free**, a malicious grin returning to his face.

> "I knew it wasn't yours to wield."

---

**Luffy stares.**

**Eyes wide. Jaw clenched.**

> "No... come on... don't give out on us now..."

---

Back below-

**Tashigi sees it.**

**Vivi feels it.**

The link is fraying.

---

You-barely aware-feel something shift.

Like a **classroom being abandoned before the last question is answered**.  
Like the **lesson ending** before the test is done.

---

You don't want to go.

But your body is shutting down.

---

**OOC:**

Your next breath might be your last unless something intervenes.  
The elemental is fading in tandem.

Would you like to:

1. {Let go. Drift into unconsciousness. Trust in the others.}  
2. {Call out mentally-desperately-to the elemental. One last command.}  
3. {Reach for someone-Vivi, Tashigi, anyone. Try to tether yourself with their presence.}

>> USER: ​Option 3 - Something about Snack Pack, the Bananagator. Also the two blurry figures in my vision.

OOC: the elemental, while big, is relatively slow, and hasn't been able to land anything other than glancing hits, so crocodile is only lightly moistened. However, Luffy is fully coated with liquid. Smoker is injured.

---

Your fingers twitch on the stone.

The world has gone **soft around the edges**, like wet chalk left out in the rain. Sounds are **muted**, warped-your heartbeat is a distant drum. Your skin is buzzing, but your limbs feel like they're filled with pudding and regret.

You blink once.

Twice.

**Vision swims.**

Everything in front of you is a wash of **bright sand and green vapor**, and in the middle of it-

> **Two blurry silhouettes.**

One is **small, hunched**, protective. The other **tall, sturdy**, maybe holding something.

And somewhere in the blur-

You see it.

**Snack Pack.**

A Bananagator.

Majestic. Beautiful. Emotionally unstable and weirdly fast for its size.

---

You exhale.

A wheeze, more breath than voice.

> "...Snack Pack..."

Your cracked lips try to form more.

> "He... he never got his final race..."

Your voice breaks. You don't even know who you're talking to.

> "He had so m</pre>
