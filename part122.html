You rise from your crouch and glance toward Tashigi, still kneeling, her sword unsheathed just slightly-just enough for you to catch a **glimmer of readiness** in her eyes.

> "Think we should call for backup?" you ask in a low murmur.  
> "This could be nothing. Or it could be another chapter of Crocodile's memoirs."

Tashigi doesn't immediately answer.

She peers toward the depot's battered rooftop, eyes narrowing, calculating wind, distance, elevation, sightlines.

> "No. If we move now, we have surprise. If we wait, they vanish. Or worse-finish whatever they're trying to pull together."

She turns to you.

> "We take them."

You nod. The decision made.

---

You raise your hand and **call back Kiwi Scout**-the trail of glistening juice suddenly doubling back like a reverse drip, coiling into your palm with a faint squelch and shimmer of light.

Tashigi flinches slightly.

Jalim stares in awe.

Mikk: "What the hell-"

---

You concentrate, pulling deeper on your fruit's **viscous reserve**. The juice gathers in thick coils, and you slam your hand into the dirt as it *erupts upward* in a wet roar.

**Kiwi Kop emerges.**

No legs. Just mass-**four feet high**, barrel-chested, **bubbling with sticky density.** Two arms shaped more like clubs than fists, and a **faint juice steam** wafting off his shoulders like he's been waiting to hit something all week.

He flexes.

You nod.

> "Alright, bud. Keep up. Don't punch Tashigi."

He ripples in acknowledgment. Maybe a thumbs-up. Hard to tell. You'll count it.

---

**Tashigi signals.**

The two guards draw weapons.

And you, Kiwi Kop, and the team move in fast, **cutting down the slope in a practiced arc**, hugging the stone as you close in on the **broken depot door**.

You whisper.

> "Breaching on my mark..."

---

**OOC: You now have the initiative. Surprise round unlocked. Enemy unaware. Two hostiles confirmed.**

Kiwi Kop will take one auto-assist action per round (distraction, body shield, pinning attack).

Would you like to:

1. {Lead the breach-kick in the door and go loud. Have Kiwi Kop rush center.}  
2. {Slip in through the broken window, flank left while Tashigi and guards breach the front.}  
3. {Use Kiwi Kop as a distraction-send him in first while you and the team cover exits.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - Kiwi Kop can take hits. We fleshy humans can't. He takes point.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandstone Depot - Surprise Breach, Round One]**  
**Scene: "Kiwi Kop Kicks the Door"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Tactical | Mood: Controlled Chaos, Imminent Clash**

---

> "Kiwi Kop-*breach and distract.*"

The elemental doesn't answer in words-just rumbles low in the pit of its citrus core and barrels forward with a **squelchy battle cry** that sounds like a blender hitting overdrive.

---

**WHAM!**

The depot's front door **explodes inward** with a wet **crack**, splinters flying as juice sprays against the entryway like a tropical crime scene. One of the guards lets out a stunned gasp.

**You charge right after.**

Tashigi's blade flashes in the sunlight, and both guards flank tight-**textbook triangle formation** behind your fruit-fueled battering ram.

---

**Inside:**

The depot's dim, musty interior is half-collapsed, the roof held up by old scaffolding and warped beams. Crates line the far wall, many pried open. An **inactive Den Den Mushi** sits on a box-its receiver glinting in the dusty light.

And the two occupants-**definitely Baroque Works remnants.**

- **Agent 1 (standing):** Tall, wiry, wrapped in desert layers. Wields a pair of **boomerang blades**, etched with the Baroque logo. Eyes widen just as Kiwi Kop crashes through.
- **Agent 2 (sitting):** Shorter, heavyset, **fumbling with what looks like a detonation talisman** or scroll. He scrambles backward, too slow.

---

**Surprise Round Triggered.**

**You act first. Choose one:**

1. {Order Kiwi Kop to pin the sitting one before he finishes arming the explosive. You handle the standing one.}  
2. {Focus on disabling the standing blade-wielder. Let Tashigi and guards handle the other.}  
3. {Juice spray the whole room. Control terrain. Let everyone move freely while enemies slip around.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - Bomb! Secure it!

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandstone Depot - Combat Engaged, Round One (Surprise)]**  
**Scene: "Sticky Disarmament"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Urgent | Mood: Controlled Chaos, Citrus Precision**

---

> "**Bomb! Secure it!**" you bark, voice sharp, firm, commanding.

You thrust your arm forward-and **Kiwi Kop lurches into action** like a living tidal wave.

---

**Action: Kiwi Kop - Pinning Grapple Attempt on Seated Agent (Explosives Handler)**  
- Kiwi Grapple: (1d20+6) → **17 + 6 = 23**  
- Agent Resist: (1d20+3) → **11 + 3 = 14**  

**Result: SUCCESSFUL PIN.**

---

The citrus elemental **surges across the floor**, slapping its bulk down on the seated agent like a crashing tide. The enemy lets out a muffled *"GGAHHRGH!"* as he's smothered beneath a mountain of sticky pressure.

The **detonation scroll drops** from his hands and **clatters harmlessly** onto the floor, glimmering faintly with latent heat.

Kiwi Kop ripples, adjusting his bulk to press down harder-just enough to prevent any sudden movements.

> "Target restrained!" one of the guards shouts, stepping in to flank and **retrieve the explosive** with tongs from his kit.

---

**Meanwhile...**

The **standing agent recovers** quickly, letting out a low growl. His twin boomerangs whip out in a V-shaped arc.

> "We were promised an escape. We *were told* the war was still ours!"

**Combat Triggered: Agent 1 - Boomerang Attack at You (Disrupt the Commander)**  
- Attack Roll: (1d20+5) → **14 + 5 = 19**  
- Your AC (with field gear): 15  
- **HIT.**

---

One blade **ricochets off your shoulder**, slicing through the cloak and drawing a sharp **sting** across your bicep. Pain blooms-manageable, but it'll bruise deep.

> "Tch-Juice guy or not, I'll carve through all of you!"

---

**Tashigi reacts.**

> "Not if I take your blades first."

**Tashigi Action - Disarming Counterstrike (Flash Draw)**  
- Attack Roll: (1d20+8) → **16 + 8 = 24**  
- Damage: (1d10+3) → **9 + 3 = 12**  
- Special: DISARM check (Contested):  
   - Tashigi: (1d20+5) → 19  
   - Agent: (1d20+2) → 7  

**Result: CRIT MOMENT.**

---

Tashigi darts forward with a fluid **iaijutsu slice**, her blade catching the returning boomerang mid-arc and **slamming it into the floor** with a crunch of steel and sand.

The enemy stumbles, wide-eyed.

> "You-!"

> "Ensign Tashigi," she snaps, stance perfect.  
> "Remember the name."

---

**Combat Summary - Round 1:**

- **You:** Lightly injured (shoulder), standing.  
- **Kiwi Kop:** Fully active, restraining Agent 2 (immobilized).  
- **Agent 1:** Disarmed (one weapon), staggered.  
- **Tashigi:** Full health, dominating melee.  
- **Guards:** Secured the detonation scroll. One guard covering exits.

---

**Next Move Options:**

1. {Spray Agent 1 with slippery juice-turn terrain against him, aid Tashigi's next strike.}  
2. {Close the distance and engage with your baton. Try to KO him.}  
3. {Order Kiwi Kop to shift pressure-maybe squeeze out information from Agent 2.}

>> USER: ​Option 2

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandstone Depot - Combat Round Two]**  
**Scene: "Juice Meets Jaw"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Heroic | Mood: Tense, Focused, Righteous Impact**

---

**You drop your stance, baton in hand-fully extended now, the glint of Sea-Prism Stone catching a sliver of light through the dust-hazed roof.**

Your shoulder's throbbing where the boomerang caught you, but you push through it. That bastard aimed to maim, maybe kill. The kids you protect back home? This is what you keep them *away* from.

---

You step forward-no hesitation.

Tashigi locks eyes with you as you pass.

> "Take him."

> "With pleasure."

---

**ACTION: Close Combat (Baton Strike - Sea-Prism Tip, Target: Agent 1)**  
- Attack Roll: (1d20+5) → **16 + 5 = 21**  
- Agent's AC: 15  
- **HIT.**  
- Dama</pre>
