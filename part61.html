<pre>again.

> "So let me recap: Crocodile wants a super-illegal ancient artifact.  
Miss All Sunday can read the forbidden thing that erases people from existence.  
Your best friend leads the army that's trying to kill your family.  
And somehow *I'm* the only one here who's completely underqualified for this situation?"

---

Luffy, from behind, grins.

> "Yep."

Zoro shrugs.

> "Glad someone finally noticed."

Nami sighs.

> "You're the only one with a teaching license. Just roll with it."

---

**Tashigi:** "We're out of time. Make your call."

**OOC Summary of New Info:**
- **Poneglyphs** are ancient, untranslatable tablets banned by the World Government.  
  - Researching them is a crime. Robin can read them.  
- **Kohza** is the **leader of the rebel army** and **Vivi's childhood friend**.  
  - Vivi believes she can reach him emotionally and stop the fighting.
- **Crocodile's** objective is likely linked to **ancient weapons** or power recorded in the Poneglyph.

---

**Time to choose.**

Do you...

1. {Follow Tashigi to the palace. Crocodile + Cobra + Poneglyph = bad.}  
2. {Stay with Vivi. She's your student now, whether she knows it or not.}  
3. {Demand backup. You'll go nowhere without a Straw Hat.}  
4. {Refuse both. Too many unknowns. Stay central and try to coordinate between teams.}

ðŸŒ€ What's your decision, Sensei?

>> USER: Option 4 - No. No no no. I don't care about whatever your marine regs tell you to do about confirmed poneglyph activities or whatever. I'm not letting you chase a warlord alone. Hell, I'm not even going to let you chase the warlord with all of us combined. It's suicide.

Look, we're in on a warzone, so let's control the variables we can for now. Let's stick together and try to find this friend of yours to end the war. We can deal with Croc later. When we have literally anything stronger than a classroom's worth of fighters.

OOC: Note for later. crocodile may detect us, and prevent us from stopping the fighting by instigating with his sleeper agents, like canon.

> "*No.*"

You cut across the courtyard like a voice of reason in a riot.

> "No, no, no."

**Tashigi turns sharply**, her hand hovering near her sword-not from threat, but reflex. **Vivi pauses mid-step**, the wind catching the edges of her cloak. **The Straw Hats** glance over.

And then you say it:

> "I don't care what your Marine regs say about confirmed Poneglyph activity or ancient crimes against the world or whatever. I'm not letting you chase a Warlord alone."

> "Hell-*I'm not letting all of us combined* chase a Warlord right now."

---

Your baton clenches in your hand-not to threaten, but to ground yourself.

> "It's suicide. You saw what he did in Rainbase. You saw what he's done to this country. And we are not-*not*-walking into a deeper pit because someone handed us a shovel."

> "We're in a warzone. So we control what variables we can."

You glance at **Vivi**, gaze softening slightly.

> "That means ending *this* war. First. Before we even think about tomb-diving with a sand demon."

---

There's silence for a beat.

Even **Luffy** doesn't crack a joke.

---

> "We stick together," you finish.  
> "We find Kohza. We end the fighting."

> "And we deal with Crocodile later-when we've got something stronger than a classroom's worth of fighters and a goddamn duck cavalry."

---

The wind howls through the cracked windows.  
The smoke is heavier now. You hear shouting-closer than before.

---

**Tashigi**'s jaw is tight. Her grip white-knuckled.

But she breathes in slowly.

And exhales.

> "...Fine."

> "One war at a time."

She glances at Vivi, then gives you a single sharp nod.

> "But if we survive this and he escapes because we waited-*that's on you.*"

---

**Vivi**, quietly, finally lets out a breath she'd been holding.

> "Thank you," she says. "We end the war first."

---

**OOC Note - Canon Divergence Locked In:**

- You have **halted Tashigi's direct pursuit** of Crocodile.  
- Your group will now **remain together** to seek **Kohza** and end the **open rebellion**.  
- As in canon, Crocodile may grow suspicious and **deploy sleeper agents** to **ensure fighting continues** regardless of your progress.

This may force a confrontation **before you're ready.**

But for now-

You're not walking into the dark alone.

---

Would you like to initiate the **search for Kohza**, or strategize with the crew on how to approach the city battlefield?

>> USER: On me? I'm not even a government employee, what would they even charge me with, obstruction?

Anyways... I turn to Vivi. Blue. I don't know jack about Alubarna. I'll let you lead the way. What are your orders?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna City - Chain of Command: Established]**  
**Scene: "The Crown and the Chalkboard"**  
**Tone: Snappy Respect | Mood: Trust Reforged in the Fire**

---

You turn sharply back toward **Tashigi**, eyes flashing beneath the bruises and dust.

> "*On me?* Lady, I'm not even a government employee. What are they gonna do, charge me with **obstruction of justice** for refusing to let a half-dead schoolteacher walk into the world's most illegal tomb with a glorified book club and a dream?"

You grunt and stretch your ribs until something crunches unpleasantly.

> "Let â€˜em try."

---

There's a brief silence-then a loud **cough-laugh-snort** from Usopp behind you.

Even **Zoro** cracks the ghost of a smirk.

**Tashigi**, against her better judgment, almost smiles.

---

Then you turn to **Vivi**, dusting off your tone and slipping into something steadier.  
More grounded. More you.

> "Alright, Blue."

> "I don't know jack about this city."

You gesture broadly at the burning skyline.

> "It's a maze of alleys and politics, and I'm good at neither. You know where the pulse of the rebellion is better than anyone."

You straighten a little. Despite the limp. Despite the blood.

And you say it clearly:

> "*I'll let you lead the way.*"

> "What are your orders?"

---

**Vivi blinks.**

Not because she didn't expect to lead-

But because she didn't expect **you** to say it like that.  
Like a fellow adult.  
Like someone who **trusts her.**

---

She breathes in deeply. Composes herself. Then nods, all trace of doubt vanishing from her posture.

> "We're going to the **clock tower plaza** in the First District. It's a central landmark-Kohza's most likely to try and make a stand there. If he's trying to force a message or signal a breakthrough, that's where he'll do it."

She swings her leg back over the duck and dismounts, drawing her slasher ring and setting her shoulders.

> "We'll cut across the western alleyways to avoid major fighting. If we move fast, we can make it before sunset."

---

You hear the roar of cannons in the far distance.

You have a direction.  
You have a leader.

And **for once**-the kids are following **her.**

---

**OOC: Direction set.**  
Vivi is now **tactically leading the party** to seek Kohza.  
All crew members are following her command, with **you as her second-in-command** in practical and moral terms.

**Next Scene: Cross-City Run - Through Alubarna's Burning Veins.**

Would you like to proceed into the **city traversal scene**, or speak privately with a party member before departure?

>> USER: Sounds as good a plan as any. Let's move. 

I feel a bit of juice returning to my veins, but certainly nowhere close enough to fight with it.

I take up a defensive position around Vivi as well move through the alleys, close to Tashigi.

I murmur. The poneglyphs... You think Crocodile can really destroy the world if he learns their secrets?
