<pre>Who are the elite agents engaging us right now, from Canon?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - Mid-Skirmish: Protective Vigil]**  
**Tone: Focused and Guarded | Mood: Protector Role Solidified**

---

You don't chase the victory.

Bon Clay may be writhing under a glorious citrus sarcophagus, and Tashigi may be storming over with murder in her eyes, but your **priority hasn't changed**.

You glance at Vivi.

Still beside you. Still alert. Still alive.

You resume your stance-mist low, juice primed, baton gripped-not gloating, not advancing, just **watching**.

Because you're not here to look cool.

You're here to make sure she **makes it to Alubarna**.

---

Your eyes flick around the battlefield, searching for those who might need backup-

- **Zoro** is locked with **Mr. 1 (Daz Bones)**. His steel body is proving difficult. The fight's intense, but balanced.
- **Nami** is fending off **Miss Doublefinger** with her clima-tact-weather forming, but she's getting pressed.
- **Usopp** is mostly hiding and lobbing explosives at footsoldiers.
- **Chopper** is supporting him in Guard Point, holding the line.
- **Tashigi** is wrapping up her scimitar opponent and closing in on Bon Clay-you assume it's going to be *very personal*.
- **Luffy** is finishing up a fight with a non-elite Baroque enforcer-he hasn't fought **Crocodile** yet, per the altered timeline.

---

**OOC: Canon Elite Agents Active in This Ambush:**  
The Baroque Works agents deployed at the Sandora crossing in canon (and present in your version of the arc):

- **Mr. 1 (Daz Bones)** - Engaged with Zoro. Supersharp steel body. Stoic, deadly.
- **Miss Doublefinger** - Engaged with Nami. Spiky-piercing body via the Spike-Spike Fruit.
- **Mr. 2 Bon Clay** - Immobilized by you. Likely to be defeated by Tashigi next.
- (Possibly) **Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas** - The bazooka dog and mole duo may appear *later* depending on how this fight resolves.
- Canonically, **Mr. 3** is elsewhere due to earlier events, unless modified.
- **Crocodile** himself is not present-he is in motion, headed for Alubarna with Robin.

---

**Current Tactical Note:**  
- **You are the only combatant not engaged in a direct fight**-this gives you options.  
- Your vigil over Vivi is still essential, but you can take shots, support allies, or direct the battlefield.  
- You are likely the best candidate for **reactive support** due to your ranged capabilities and sensory control.

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Send a shot of acidic mist toward Miss Doublefinger-Nami's in real trouble.}  
2. {Whistle for Tashigi-let her have her moment with Bon Clay. "He's yours."}  
3. {Call out to Vivi. "Stay close, I might need to cover one of them."}  
4. {Layer sticky juice near Nami or Usopp. Slow the enemy down so they can recover.}  
5. {Continue observing. Ready to intercept if anyone approaches Vivi. Patience is power.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 5 - You holding up okay, blue? I look at her worriedly.

OOC: my character may be becoming overbearing, in a naggy protective parent kind of way.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River Skirmish - Watchful Eyes & Worry Lines]**  
**Tone: Gentle Vigilance | Mood: Protector with a Pinch of Dad Energy**  
**ðŸŽ¯ Emotional Outcome: Vivi hears the worry. She feels the weight of your concern. And she's *starting to wonder* if your protectiveness is more than just duty.**

---

You glance once more toward the front lines.

> Nami's ducking under a shard-laced lunge.  
> Zoro's taking hits from steel fists and getting *angrier*, not weaker.  
> Tashigi is currently **storming toward her own face**, and frankly, you're not emotionally ready to unpack that.

But **Vivi**...

Still behind you.  
Still holding her weapons.  
Still trying not to flinch every time something explodes nearby.

You keep your voice low as the wind howls over the dunes.

> "You holding up okay, Blue?"

You don't even mean to make it sound parental.

But it *does*.

You look at her, brows furrowed with worry, scanning her for bruises, for shakes, for any crack in the facade.

---

**Vivi blinks.**

Just once. Then twice.

> "I'm-fine."

She sounds like someone **who's trying not to snap** at the person fussing over her too much. Not because she's ungrateful.

But because **she's a princess** who's been **fighting for her kingdom alone** for months-and suddenly someone's hovering like a stressed-out school counselor.

She glances at you sideways.

> "You know you're the first person to ask me that in a long time?"

There's a smile in her voice.

But her eyes are... complicated.

> "Not even Igaram asked like that. And he raised me like a daughter."

---

She pauses, then says:

> "You're a little... intense, you know?"

She softens it with a faint smirk.

> "A good kind of intense.  
Just... maybe remember I'm not made of glass, Cheng."

---

**OOC: You are absolutely giving off Concerned Adult vibes**-in the best way, but it's becoming *noticeable*.  
To Vivi, it's a mix of refreshing, mildly suffocating, and *just a little bit endearing.*

You're not treating her like a princess.

You're treating her like a *person worth saving.*

And in Vivi's world?  
That's rare.

---

**Combat is still ongoing, but Vivi is holding her ground.  
Your moment lands. She sees you.**

---

**What's next?**

1. {Back off slightly-nod and say, "Got it, Blue. You say the word if that changes."}  
2. {Offer a joke. "Sorry, it's the teacher instincts. My students are usually shorter and less royalty."}  
3. {Double down. "Not taking any chances. You're the reason we're all here."}  
4. {Step to the side-let her lead for a few seconds. Respect her strength.}  
5. {Return to combat readiness-your talk's done. The juice is calling.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 2 - someone's got to make you you kids aren't falling apart. After all, this shouldn't have been your fight. You kids should be enjoying life, not fighting for you lives.

...Also, who's Igaram?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River Skirmish - The Teacher's Lament]**  
**Tone: Gentle Frustration | Mood: Protector's Honesty Meets Royal Resilience**

---

You exhale, shake your head, and give her a dry smile-the kind you usually save for a student who just turned in a test written entirely in crayon.

> "Someone's gotta make sure you kids aren't falling apart."

You glance back at the battlefield, where Zoro is now *actively using blood as intimidation*, and Nami is screaming something that involves the word "spike-witch."

> "After all... this shouldn't have been your fight."

You look at Vivi again. Not like a soldier. Not like a subject.  
Just a *kid.*

> "You should be enjoying life, not fighting for it."

---

There's a long pause.  
The wind whistles.  
Vivi stares forward, eyes flicking across the chaos like she's memorizing every scar this war is going to leave behind.

Then, softly:

> "You sound like my father."

A beat.

> "*And* my chief bodyguard. Igaram."

You blink.

> "...Who's Igaram?"

---

She actually laughs.

> "Big hair. Bigger voice. Always fretting about my safety. Would throw himself into a bonfire if it meant keeping me from burning my toe."

She smiles faintly.

> "He helped me get into Baroque Works undercover. Risked everything for it."

Then the smile fades a little.

> "He didn't make it far."

A pause.

> "Or... maybe he did. I don't know. I never saw him after we split."

---

Her voice doesn't tremble. But you can tell-it's not because it doesn't hurt.

It's because she's **used to hurting quietly**.

You've heard that tone before.

> In students whose parents don't come home.  
> In kids who grow up too fast because the world can't afford to let them stay young.

---

She glances at you again.

> "So if you're gonna hover like a worried uncle, just know...  
you're not the first."

Another beat. Then, gentler:

> "But maybe the first one I don't mind."

**OOC Emotional Development:**  
- Vivi is opening up. She doesn't resent your protec</pre>
