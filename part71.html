>> USER: Option 1 - Hey... That's an... Interesting looking cloud.

OOC: Per canon, Smoker is likely no match for Crocodile, would like not want to engage directly. But given what he's seen, his injured subordinate, a warlord on the cusp of victory, he chooses to dive in to fight, even if just to by time for something, anything

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - Smoke on the Horizon, Storm at the Summit]**  
**Scene: "A Cloud You Don't Want to Grade Papers With"**  
**Tone: Grave Humor | Mood: A Breath Before Impact**

---

You're still curled up like a **citrus-drenched larva**, too broken to do more than flick juice and twitch your eyebrows.

But you squint toward the sky.

And you see it again.

A thick, rolling **plume of smoke**, parting the desert air like it **doesn't care about physics**, weather, or your good vacation plans.

---

You rasp out, barely audible to the others around you:

> "Hey..."

> "That's an... interesting-looking cloud."

---

**Nami** glances skyward.  
Her brow furrows.

> "That's not a cloud."

**Zoro's grip tightens.**  
**Chopper's ears go stiff.**  
**Vivi turns. Her eyes widen.**

Because now, everyone sees it.

And it's not a cloud.

It's a **Marine.**

---

### **Cut to: Above the Palace**

**Luffy hits the rooftop again.**

Coughing. Bleeding. Barely staying upright.

**Crocodile** stands over him, unhurried. Calm. Calculated.

He raises a sand-clawed hand, aiming for Luffy's chest.

---

> "I'm done playing."

---

And then-

> *THWOOOSH-!*

A **pillar of white smoke** blasts down from above, crashing between the two fighters like a divine exhale.

**Sand collides with smoke**, billowing outward in a thunderous hiss.

The rooftop shakes.

Tiles explode.

**Crocodile stumbles back. Eyes narrowing.**

> "...You."

---

Standing in the center of the clash, coat billowing, arms crossed, **is Captain Smoker**.

---

> "Warlord or not, I've had it with your games."

He glances sideways at Luffy-bleeding, swaying, not yet defeated.

> "I don't like pirates..."

> "But I like tyrants even less."

---

**Luffy grins.**

Because he knows what this means.

**One more second. One more breath. That's all he needs.**

---

Crocodile growls.

> "You think smoke can beat sand?"

> "I think pain buys time."

Smoker slams his fists together. The white cloud **erupts** outward like a curtain of vengeance.

---

And the rooftop **erupts into chaos.**

---

**OOC:**
- Smoker has entered the fight to **buy time**, not win.
- His attack disrupts Crocodile just as he was preparing a finishing blow on Luffy.
- Luffy now has a **crucial window** to regroup.
- The Straw Hats and Vivi are aware of the marine's arrival.
- You, Sensei, remain the one who first spotted the tide-turning smoke.

Would you like to:

1. {Comment on the situation like a battered war veteran substitute teacher.}  
2. {Try to give tactical advice-how to *actually* hit Crocodile.}  
3. {Just lie there, fully committed to being the most observant human kiwi on the battlefield.}

>> USER: Option 2 - I stare. So... How the hell do we even beat this guy? Do you have any super royal guards in your basement, blue? Now would be a good time

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - Tactical Questions From the Ground]**  
**Scene: "An Appropriate Time to Ask for a Miracle"**  
**Tone: Dry | Mood: Tactical Desperation Dressed as Humor**

---

You stare up at the rooftop battleground, **eyes squinting through blood and sand**, watching **smoke and sand clash** like two natural disasters having a very personal disagreement.

> *So that's Smoker...*

You're honestly impressed the guy hasn't been **dissolved yet**, but you're also **keenly aware** that the only reason Luffy is still breathing is because someone **just got angrier than the Warlord.**

But that can't last.

So you mutter-loud enough to catch **Vivi's** attention as she kneels near you, still watching the storm overhead.

---

> "So... how the hell do we even beat this guy?"

Your voice is hoarse, dry, but still lined with sarcasm. That teacher-tone that says *I've graded worse situations before, and they all ended in detention.*

> "Do you have any super royal guards in your basement, Blue?"

A wheeze.

> "Now would be a good time..."

---

**Vivi exhales sharply**, somewhere between a laugh and a sob.

> "No super guards. Just me..."

She trails off.

Then straightens a little.

> "But... we *do* have the Poneglyph."

---

That draws **Nami's** eyes.

> "What, you think we can *drop it* on him?"

**Usopp** blinks.  
> "Wait, can we?!"

---

**You raise a shaky hand.**

> "Hold up-hold up."

> "This guy's made of *sand*. You punch him, he falls apart. You slash him, he *laughs*. He drains people *by touching them*. He's got sand *inside* the building..."

You point, weakly, at the clashing **Smoker and Luffy**.

> "He's toying with both a pirate captain and a Marine..."

Then you lock eyes with Vivi.

> "So unless that ancient stone has a juice box hidden in it-"

---

**Zoro, nearby, grunts.**

> "He's right. We're not hurting him like this."

**Nami frowns, then slowly looks toward you.**

> "You said... he dries things out."

**You nod.**

> "Yeah. Moisture. That's how he kills."

**Her eyes widen.**

> "Then the only way to hit him..."

> "Is to be *wetter than he can dry.*"

---

That lands like a thunderclap.

All eyes turn to the rooftop.

To **Luffy**-cracked lips, bruised eyes.

And Crocodile, raising his clawed hand again.

---

They turn back to you.

Specifically, your **fruity-ass self**, laying in a puddle of kiwi juice like a defeated smoothie mascot.

---

**OOC:**
You've reignited the central tactical clue: **Crocodile can be hit if he's soaked.**  
Nami has picked up on the idea.  
Vivi and the crew now understand the path to victory-but must act fast.

Would you like to:

1. {Offer your juice. It's humiliating. But it may just save the brat.}  
2. {Let them figure it out. You've done your part. Fade into the background like a noble citrus casualty.}  
3. {Say something ridiculous but inspirational. Something only a high school teacher with head trauma could say.}

>> USER: Option X - I raise an arm weakly. That's... An interesting idea. But given his power level, I think he can dry me out faster than I can juice. Like a really sad battle of attrition, but it looks like a warlord sucking a crumpling juice box dry

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - Citrus Analysis at the End of the World]**  
**Scene: "Do Not Suck the Kiwi Box"**  
**Tone: Gallows Humor | Mood: Genius Hidden Behind Deadpan Despair**

---

You raise your arm.

It shakes like a flag in a light breeze.  
It's sticky.  
It's green.  
You're pretty sure a fly has landed on it at least once this hour.

---

> "That's... an interesting idea."

Everyone leans in.

Hope flickers across their eyes.

Maybe you have a plan.  
Maybe you're going to **unleash** something.  
Maybe this is your big hero moment.

You sigh.

> "But given his power level, I think he can dry me out faster than I can juice."

A beat.

Then, you deadpan:

> "Like a really sad battle of attrition."

> "But it *looks* like a Warlord sucking a crumpling juice box dry."

---

**Usopp makes a noise that's halfway between a laugh and a horrified whimper.**

**Nami** covers her mouth with a hand, eyes wide, not sure if she's about to giggle or throw up.

**Vivi** just shakes her head in disbelief.

> "You're unbelievable..."

> "You're dying. And you're making jokes about juice boxes."

---

**Zoro smirks.**

> "He's got a point."

> "A really messed up one, but a point."

---

**Chopper stares at you.**

> "You are... medically... very strange."

---

But something settles in the group.

That tension cracks just a little.

Not relief. Not peace.
