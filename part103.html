>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - The Dining Hall, Mid-Honeycake]**  
**Scene: "Permission to Be Ridiculous"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Respectful | Mood: Curious, Whimsical, Weighted with a Promise**

---

A fork halfway to your mouth.

A honeycake, warm and glistening, neglected just for a moment.

You glance at **King Cobra**, then lower your utensil with a careful clink onto your plate.

You sit a little straighter, clear your throat-not nervously, but with the oddly formal sincerity of a man who knows exactly **how absurd he's about to sound**.

---

> "Apologies, Your Majesty."

Cobra's gaze flickers upward, his hand pausing mid-cut through a honeyed fig.

You continue.

> "I made a promise the other day... and I feel obligated to keep it."

A pause.

> "May I have permission to do something..."

> "...*silly?*"

---

A beat.

The *entire* table stills.

**Tashigi's brows raise.**  
**Vivi turns slowly to look at you.**  
Even one of the servers standing by the door visibly leans a *little closer.*

---

**King Cobra**, the ruler of Alabasta, the man who's stared down warlords, spies, and revolutions, doesn't blink.

He places his utensils down with a soft *clink.*

Then steeples his fingers beneath his chin.

> "Mr. Cheng."

> "You conjured a titan of citrus, toppled a criminal empire, and possibly changed the trajectory of this nation with a fruit power that violates most culinary laws."

---

His mouth twitches. A faint smile forming.

> "I think you've more than earned the right to be a little... *silly.*"

---

**Vivi lets out a tiny laugh** behind her hand.

**Tashigi squints at you**, as if trying to predict what you're about to do and failing *utterly.*

---

> "Very well," Cobra says, leaning back.

> "The floor is yours."

---

**OOC:**

Would you like to:

1. {Deliver on the silly promise immediately at the table.}
2. {Request a small section of the courtyard for... your endeavor.}
3. {Tell them first *what* the promise was.}

>> USER: OOC - Do Vivi and Tashigi know what the promise is?

>> ASSISTANT: **OOC Answer:**

At present, **Vivi and Tashigi do *not*** know what the promise is.

Let's break it down:

---

### 💙 **Vivi**:
She looks *curious*, not expectant. Her expression is a mixture of **delight** and **caution**, like she's watching a child approach a piñata with a suspiciously long sword.

She doesn't know what you're planning.

But-*given her nature*-she's likely assuming it's some heartfelt gesture... maybe a monument to peace, a weirdly heartfelt kiwi statue, or a musical number. (She would be absolutely delighted and mildly horrified if it turned out to be anything else.)

---

### ⚔️ **Tashigi**:
Her eyes have narrowed slightly. She's analyzing. **She suspects you're up to something.** But she hasn't pinned it yet. She remembers *you said something about a promise,* but not in a way that clued her in.

If she had known what it was...

She'd have already tried to **talk you out of it.** Or *threaten to arrest you* out of sheer embarrassment.

---

### 👑 **Cobra**:
He has **zero idea** what you're referring to.

But he looks like a man who once let a noble try to ride a camel backwards into Parliament as a bet and now just wants to see *where the hell this goes.*

---

**Conclusion:**
You, and you alone, carry the secret burden of this **"silly promise."**  
What happens next?

Entirely up to you.

Would you like to:

1. {Reveal the promise to the table before performing it.}
2. {Say nothing-deliver it dramatically.}
3. {Ask them to join you in the courtyard, where it will be unveiled.}

>> USER: Option 2 - Stand up. Walk around the table and stop next to Cobra's seat. Before anyone can react, before any guards can crash tackle me, I draw my baton...

And then lightly thwack him on the knee.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Dining Hall, Seconds Before Absolute Chaos]**  
**Scene: "The Knee Incident"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Deadpan Brilliance | Mood: Suspense, Shock, Then... Hysteria**

---

You rise from your chair.

Calmly.

Deliberately.

The air shifts.

**Tashigi's eyes narrow instantly**, her hand drifting toward her sword, like her body remembers the time you declared you were a "greased torpedo" and dove headfirst into enemy forces.

**Vivi straightens, blinking**, her fork paused halfway to her mouth, a bit of melon still skewered mid-air.

**Cobra remains seated**, ever the composed monarch, though you swear one of his eyebrows lifts just a *fraction*-not in fear, but in **royal intrigue.**

---

You round the table.

Each step echoes in the great chamber.

And as you near the king's side, you can *feel* the palace guards tensing along the walls.  
Hands resting on hilts.  
Eyes flicking to each other, unsure if they're witnessing a sudden coup... or a *very polite mental breakdown.*

---

You stop beside **King Cobra**.

And in a single motion-quick, clean, and utterly absurd-

> **You draw your baton... and lightly thwack him on the knee.**

---

*THWAP.*

---

There's a moment of absolute **silence.**

The kind where **every cup stills**, **every breath halts**, and somewhere, a harp string probably *snaps in fear.*

---

And then, before anyone can tackle you...

Before Tashigi can shout **"WHAT THE HELL-"**  
Before the guards can scream **"SEIZE HIM-"**  
Before Vivi can even *blink-*

---

You calmly, professionally, respectfully say:

> "...Promise fulfilled."

---

**Beat.**

**Another beat.**

**Cobra looks down at his knee.**  
Then up at you.  
Then down again.

> "Was that... it?"

---

You nod. Serious.

> "I promised someone I'd break the knees of the next Alabastan government official I saw."

> "Didn't say how hard."

---

**Cobra stares at you.**

You can *feel* Tashigi short-circuiting behind you.

**Vivi covers her mouth-shoulders shaking-**  
And then bursts into *pure, unfiltered laughter*.

---

> "You... *idiot*," Tashigi chokes out, hand halfway over her face.  
> "You *actual pineapple-shaped idiot-*"

---

**King Cobra starts laughing too.**

It's deep.

Full.

Real.

Not the practiced chuckle of a diplomat, but the kind of laugh that comes from a man who's carried **too much weight**, for **too long**, and just needed someone to *break the tension.*

Even if it meant a **royal shin thwacking.**

---

He wipes his eyes, still chuckling.

> "You really are... *exactly what this country needed.*"

---

He turns to the guards, who still look halfway between confused and horrified.

> "At ease. No need to execute the man."

> "Yet."

---

**Vivi collapses sideways into her chair**, nearly wheezing.

Tashigi sits back down hard, muttering something about requisitioning a **"Sensei Containment Protocol."**

---

And you?

You just sit down.

Pick up your tea.

Sip.

Like *nothing happened.*

---

**OOC:**
Promise fulfilled.  
Legend solidified.  
And now, you're officially the only man in Alabasta with permission to assault the king **just a little.**

Would you like to:

1. {Continue breakfast with the most chaotic respect you've ever earned.}  
2. {Leave the table, casually drop a "See? Told you it was silly."}  
3. {Ask Cobra if you're now eligible for diplomatic immunity.}

>> USER: Option 1 - I made a promise to a certain 'blue', and I intended on keeping it. Not sagely.

Totally not sweating at the looks the guards are giving me.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Dining Hall, Five Seconds Post-Royal Assault]**  
**Scene: "The Honorable, Illegal Knee-Tap"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Faux Stoic | Mood: Glorious Chaos, Earned Respect, Hidden Panic**

---

You sit down.

Slowly. Casually.

As if you didn't just become the only known man in Alabastan history to **physically strike the monarch** and then *sip tea like it was part of your morning routine.*

---

Your cup returns to your lips.

You raise it slightly, not looking at anyone in particular.

> "I made a promise to a certain ‘Blue.'"

You inhale the scent of jasmine.

> "And I intend to keep it."

---

The guards </pre>
