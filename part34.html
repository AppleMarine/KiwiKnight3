<pre>.}  
2. {Climb. Get distance. Regroup later. You did your job. You're not dying for drama.}  
3. {Wait at the top of the shaft, baton drawn. Just one hit. Make it count.}  
4. {Leave a pulpy, acidic parting gift. Overcharge the vent. Burn and blind him before you go.}  
5. {Brace yourself. Take a deep breath. "Let's go, warlord." You're standing your ground.}

üåÄ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Pineapple?!

Option X - attempt to follow the path Tashigi and co went down. Only to lose their trail. I... I don't have a map on me. It wouldn't have hurt her to wait another second...

>> ASSISTANT: **üé≤ Option X Selected - "Pineapple?! Wait-Tashigi-*where the hell did you go?*"**  
**Tone: Post-Adrenaline Comedown | Action: Attempted Regroup + Sad Lost Fruit Energy**  
**üé≤ Trail-Follow Roll - (Eatone +1 Environmental Awareness, -2 No Map, +1 Mild Citrus Residue Trail) = Result: 2 [Fair]**  
**üé≤ Emotional Roll - (Eatone +2 Righteous Frustration, -1 Betrayed by Speed, +1 Tactical Humility) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**‚úÖ Outcome: You follow their path... for a bit. But the trail splits, and you're left in the quiet aftermath of your hero moment, slightly sticky, mostly alone, and wondering if "Pineapple" is a slur now.**

---

> "*Pineapple?!*"

You sputter as the **last green traces of the juice fall from your sleeves**, still pulsing from the effort of the escape.  
You lurch down the corridor after them, feet half-sliding, baton still wet with adrenaline.

The sounds of the Straw Hats, of Tashigi's sharp commands, are already fading.  
You skid around the next bend-

> Nothing.

Just **two branching hallways**, both dark.  
Both sloping upward.  
Both vaguely citrus-slick from your earlier flood.

You frown. Hard.

> "It wouldn't have killed her to wait **another damn second**..."

You run a few steps into one passage. Pause. Backtrack. Try the other.

Still **no footprints**, no voices. Just the slow **drip of retreating water**, the faint **shiver of residual fear** still clinging to the walls.

You stop.  
Put your hands on your knees.  
Exhale.

> "I save them, I catch them, I tank *Banana Gators*, I flood a warlord's hallway like a busted juice bar,  
and I still end up **alone** with no map, no backup, and now I'm the *pineapple* guy?"

Your voice echoes.  
Mocking.  
Your citrus-scented echo fades into silence.

---

**No sign of the crew. No sign of Crocodile-yet.**

But you are, for now, alone.  
**Safe-ish. Exhausted. Alive.**

---

**üìù Status Update:**

- Health: Bruised but not broken  
- Juice reserves: **Low, recharging slowly**  
- Morale: Sinking but sarcastic  
- Environment: Labyrinthine corridors. No current threats.  
- Crocodile: Delayed. Possibly redirected. Possibly hunting.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Sit. Breathe. Rehydrate. You can't help anyone if you collapse.}  
2. {Start leaving small juice markers as you explore. Make your own map.}  
3. {Call out, softly. "Tashigi? Vivi?" Just in case someone hears.}  
4. {Press forward. You're finding a way out. One way or another.}  
5. {Duck into a side hall and hide. Let your juice recover. You might need it soon.}

üåÄ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 4 - Maybe those juice markers I dropped earlier haven't dried up yet. Attempt to follow them

>> ASSISTANT: **üé≤ Option 4 Selected - "Breadcrumb Trail, But Make It Juice."**  
**Tone: Hopeful Determination | Action: Following the Sticky Trail of Heroic Escape**  
**üé≤ Juice Residue Tracking - (Eatone +2 Fruit Scent Familiarity, +1 Environmental Memory) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**üé≤ Corridor Complexity - (Rain Dinners Basement +2 Maze Design, -1 Open Doors from Escape, -1 Juice Presence) = Result: 2 [Fair]**  
**‚úÖ Outcome: You pick up the trail. It's faint-*not perfect*-but it's enough. You push forward through the back halls of Rain Dinners, on the **heels of your squad**... still sticky, still sore, and still very much alive.**

---

You turn slowly, eyes narrowing, nose sniffing like you're tracking down a bad cafeteria prank.

> "Okay... I *was* leaving juice behind. At least a little."

You crouch low to the smooth tile floor, trailing your fingers along the baseboard.

Then-**you find it.**

A thin, faint smear of **viscous green** sliding out from the edge of a hallway turn. Too controlled to be from a fight. Too clean to be anything *but* yours.

You **grin. Weakly.**

> "Knew you'd come through, Kiwi Trail."

---

You push forward, following the subtle citrus slick:

- A droplet *here*, on a doorframe.  
- A palm smear *there*, from when Nami probably steadied herself.  
- An empty hallway, but the faint acidic scent of **motion** still lingers.

You move faster.

Your legs ache.  
Your core *burns*.  
But your **willpower holds.**

---

At the next junction, you stop.  
One smear curves **left**, but it's thin.  
The other-barely visible-heads **right**, but with more streaks. **Dragging footprints.**

> "Zoro's boots."

You smile.  
The **trail leads on**.

---

**üìù Status Update:**

- Trail Found: **Yes**  
- Direction: **Right Hallway**, mild uphill slope  
- Sound: Distant-maybe voices. Maybe movement.  
- You are still **alone**, but getting closer.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Keep following the trail-quietly, quickly. You're catching up.}  
2. {Leave a small juice sign on the wall-if anyone comes looking for *you*, they'll know.}  
3. {Call out, once. Quietly. "Zoro? Vivi?" Just in case you're close.}  
4. {Prepare a juice pulse as a flare if you need help. Not now-but soon.}  
5. {Move carefully. You're not *that* far ahead of Crocodile. He could still cut you off.}

üåÄ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 5 - Keep moving. Crocs a sand demon. He probably has FTS travel - faster than sand. I gotta get out of here, pronto

>> ASSISTANT: **üé≤ Option 5 Selected - "Move. Move. MOVE. Sand Demons Don't Walk."**  
**Tone: Tactical Urgency | Action: No More Detours, No More Teacher Patience**  
**üé≤ Survival Instinct Roll - (Eatone +2 Fear-Based Momentum, +1 Intelligence, +1 Terrain Awareness) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**üé≤ Crocodile Proximity Roll - (+2 Sand Travel, -2 Delay from Vent-Flood, -1 Citrus Blindness) = Result: 2 [Fair]**  
**‚úÖ Outcome: You stay ahead. Just barely. Crocodile may be able to travel through sand-but you're cutting corners, hitting the right trail, and **outpacing his line of pursuit.****

---

You break into a jog-then a full sprint.

> *Clack clack clack* - your boots hammer against the slick stone floor as the corridor tightens around you.  
> *Faster than sand.*  
> *FTS.*  
> You hate how clever that sounded.  
> You hate even more that it's probably **true**.

---

You round a corner-and catch another flash of **juice** on a brass door latch.  
It's smudged. Hand-shaped.  
Someone braced themselves here.

You slam your hand against the door and burst through-

> Another hallway.  
> This one **narrower**, but **brighter.**  
> Above you? The faint glimmer of **sunlight through vent grates.**

---

The casino's above you now.  
You can feel the shift in air.  
And more than that-

> **No sand.**  
This is **stonework**, not dunes.  
Crocodile would need to slow down to follow.

You keep running.

---

Somewhere behind you, you swear you hear a hiss.  
Not air. Not a gator.  
**Something dry. Ancient. Fast.**

> You don't look back.

---

**üìù Tactical Update:**

- You are officially **ahead of Crocodile**.  
- You've reached **casino-adjacent architecture**-the edge of Rain Dinners' public floor system.  
- Exit = Close.  
- Sunlight = Visible.  
- Sand Warlord = Still on your trail.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Look for stairs or signage. Time to surface. Time to vanish into the crowd.}  
2. {Kick open a door. Any door. You'll escape *through* the damn kitchen if you have to.}  
3. {Slam a juice seal over the door behind you. Might hold sand. Might not. Worth a shot.}  
4. {Call out again. If the Straw Hats are close, you're done playing lost.}  
5. {Dive </pre>
