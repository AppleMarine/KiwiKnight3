<pre>hin sheen of juice**, flowing out from your boots in a widening puddle.

A soft gloss over stone.

Barely visible.

But **strategically placed**.

---

The chain-wielder steps into range first.

He spins it in rhythmic arcs, iron hissing through the air as he whips it toward you-aiming for your legs.

But he's stepping on the juice now.

Just a bit.

---

He plants his foot-and **slips.**

> "Wha-!?"

His chain goes wide.

Tashigi doesn't miss a beat.

She **twists**, blade catching the air-and his exposed arm.

> *SLASH-!*

He howls and stumbles back, clutching his elbow.

She doesn't even look at you.

> "Good."

---

> "You're not fast," she mutters, parrying a dagger strike from the next one,  
> "but you're smart."

---

You're **exhausted.**  
Your knees are **shaking**.  
But she's still upright because **you're still upright.**

And that?

That's enough.

---

**Two enemies remain.**  
- One with daggers, circling Tashigi.  
- One flanker, hanging back-maybe waiting for an opening on *you.*

---

**OOC Status:**
- Your role is **tactical support**, limiting enemy movement.  
- Juice regeneration: **minimal but controlled.**  
- Combat cohesion with Tashigi: **Excellent.** She trusts you.

Would you:

1. {Draw the flanker's attention with baiting movement-force him out.}  
2. {Try to launch a small targeted juice glob at a dagger wielder's foot-buy Tashigi a second.}  
3. {Hold ground. Let her finish them. Preserve strength.}  
4. {Whisper something to her mid-fight-encourage, guide, or distract.}

ðŸŒ€ Next move, Sensei?

>> USER: Option 3 - Wait for Tashigi to finish her opponent first (if she can). Try to buy time with the flanker

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Back Alley - The Waiting Game]**  
**Scene: "The Best Kind of Cowardice is Tactical"**  
**Tone: Breathless Control | Mood: The Longest Seconds of Your Life**

---

You don't move.

Not because you can't-though your knees **definitely aren't thrilled** with the idea.

But because now, it's not about being brave.

It's about being **smart.**

> "Come on, Tashigi-chan," you murmur under your breath.  
> "Take him out fast... I'll keep his friend busy."

---

You shift your stance slightly-**baiting**.

Not obvious. Just enough for the flanker to **see a weakness**.

Your weight's on your left leg now. You keep your arm low. You let your baton wobble slightly like your grip's failing.

And sure enough-

The flanker starts to move.

---

You keep one eye on **Tashigi**.

She's dancing with the dagger wielder now-tight quarters, blade against blade, her feet gliding through the slick patch you laid down like she owns it.

She ducks.

> *CLANG-!*

She twists.

> *SHING-*

A scream.

The dagger wielder drops. Arm gashed. Out cold.

---

She whips around to your side just as the **flanker lunges** toward you.

---

> "Left side!" you bark.

She's already moving.

> *CLANG-!*  
> *SLASH-!*  
> *THUD.*

---

Silence.

The alley is still.

**Five Baroque agents down.**  
**You're still breathing.**  
Barely.

---

Tashigi breathes hard beside you, sweat gleaming on her brow.

She doesn't say anything for a moment.

Then:

> "...You held up."

Her tone is measured. Not overly impressed. Not dismissive.

But *respectful*.

---

You lean against the wall, catching your breath, blinking grit out of your eyes.

> "Told you I'd watch your back."

You glance at the fallen enemies.

> "Could really go for a substitute teacher about now, though."

---

**OOC: Victory Achieved.**  
- You and Tashigi have successfully defeated the tailing squad.  
- Vivi and Luffy are now en route to Kohza **uninterrupted**.  
- You are *exhausted*, but have recovered just enough juice to **defend yourself once** in an emergency.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Regroup immediately with Vivi and the Straw Hats. You've bought enough time.}  
2. {Interrogate one of the Baroque agents before they bleed out.}  
3. {Rest for a few moments. Catch your breath. You're on the edge.}  
4. {Check on Tashigi-how is she holding up after everything?}

ðŸŒ€ What's next, Sensei?

>> USER: Option 4 - You still doing alright, Tashigi-chan? I breathe heavily

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Back Alley - Blood, Dust, and Breath]**  
**Scene: "The Weight Carried in Silence"**  
**Tone: Quiet Concern | Mood: The Calm After a Close Cut**

---

You lean against the scorched alley wall, every rib reminding you they're still cracked, every breath a tug-of-war between oxygen and pain.

Your baton hand trembles.  
Your juice is more **dry pulp** than flow now.  
But you're still on your feet.

---

You glance over at **Tashigi**, who stands silently over the last downed agent, sword still held downward, tip almost touching the stone.

Blood on her glove.  
Scuffs on her glasses.  
Jaw set like a cracked statue.

She's alive.  
But she's *quiet.*

---

> "You still doing alright, Tashigi-chan?" you ask between shallow breaths, voice low.

---

She doesn't look at you at first.

Just **wipes her blade** on a fallen cloak and sheaths it with practiced ease.

Then, finally-

> "...I'm fine."

But the word doesn't *feel* fine.  
It lands flat. Heavy. Tired.

She straightens, exhales through her nose, and finally meets your gaze.

> "They were kids too."

Her voice is colder now. Not bitter. Not angry.

Just... hollow.

> "Not much older than the ones we're protecting."

---

You see it now-the way her hand lingers at her side.  
The subtle twitch in her fingers.

Not from injury.

From **restraint**.

From what it cost her to *do what she had to.*

---

She glances away.

> "We're in a country where the princess went undercover as a terrorist, the guards are double agents, and we've got pirates trying to save lives."

> "You tell me if *anyone's* doing alright."

---

The silence between you is heavier than the dust.

But it's **honest.**

---

**OOC: Tashigi is physically unharmed, but emotionally weighed down.  
She respects you deeply now-possibly more than anyone in her chain of command.  
She's shaken, but holding.**

Would you like to respond-lighten the moment, bond deeper, or move on toward the plaza?

>> USER: Yeah, you and me both. Let's... Get to the plaza. Make sure the princess hasn't been eaten by a Crocodile yet.

I start, but my legs give out.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Back Alley - Legs of Sand]**  
**Scene: "The Cost of Standing Tall"**  
**Tone: Bittersweet Collapse | Mood: Loyalty Beyond Limits**

---

> "Yeah, you and me both."

Your voice is low.  
Worn.

You push off the wall-your baton clinking as it drops slightly in your grip.

> "Let's... get to the plaza."

You take two steps forward.

> "Make sure the princess hasn't been eaten by a-"

> *thud.*

Your knees betray you.

The world tilts slightly.

Your baton clatters to the ground with a dry metallic rattle.

---

**Tashigi spins around** immediately, stepping forward to catch you before you fully collapse, her hands firm on your shoulders.

> "Hey-! Cheng-"

You blink. Your breath catches.

Not from fear.

Not from blood.

Just... **empty.**

You spent everything you had.

---

Tashigi lowers you gently to a seated position beside the alley wall.

She crouches beside you, jaw tight, checking your pulse instinctively.

> "You're alive."

> "Just... running on fumes."

---

You blink up at the sky above the alley-thin wisps of cloud drifting above the cracked towers.

And you think, somewhere in the dizziness-

> *At least it's a nice day to pass out.*

---

**Tashigi rises.**

You see her silhouetted now against the alley's end, sword drawn again.

> "Rest."

> "I'll get you to the plaza."

---

And for the first time...

She sounds **like you did.**

Back when you were protecting her.

---

**OOC: You've collapsed from exhaustion.  
This is not unconsciousness-but your body can't continue for now.  
Your juice is depleted. Your stamina is drained.  
Tashigi will get you to the plaza after checking the route.**

Would you like to say one last thing before she steps out to clear the path ahead?</pre>
