<pre> reinforcements.

> "She's just a girl-get her out of the way!"

---

> *Just a girl.*

Her fingers tremble.

> *That's all I ever was, isn't it? Just a girl playing at peace?*

---

She falls to her knees near the shattered dais where **Kohza once stood**.

Around her, the plaza is fire and sand.

And the last of her hope-

**Cracks.**

---

> "...I tried."

The words barely escape her lips.

> "I tried..."

---

And above her-**Crocodile's sand begins to swirl wider.**

He's raising his hand again.

Not to kill.

But to **demonstrate**.

A **storm is coming.**

---

**OOC:**  
Vivi is nearing a **complete emotional collapse**.  
Her words failed. Her strength is gone.  
The symbol of Alabasta is **on her knees** as Crocodile begins to unleash a larger-scale sandstorm.

The **Straw Hats are watching**, unsure whether to break formation or save her.

Would you like to:

1. {Continue with Vivi's breakdown and what might pull her out.}  
2. {Jump to Luffy witnessing Vivi's despair and deciding to act.}  
3. {Cut to Eatone, feeling the shift in pressure, making a decision.}

>> USER: Option 1 and 2 - Meanwhile, back in an alley, somewhere, I continue laying around like a dried up earthworm

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - When Words No Longer Work]**  
**Scene: "The Princess and the Pirate"**  
**Tone: Cracked Hope | Mood: The Flame Flickering Out**

---

**Vivi is still kneeling.**

Fists clenched in the dust.  
Sand swirls in the air, thickening the air in her lungs.  
Even the colors feel muted. Like the city is dying in slow motion around her.

> "I tried..."  
> "I really tried..."

She doesn't cry.

She **doesn't have the energy** left to cry.

She just kneels and listens to the **roar of war**, knowing her voice was **never loud enough**.

Knowing she couldn't stop it.

Knowing she failed.

---

And then-

**A shadow steps in front of her.**

---

**Straw Hat Luffy.**

Dust on his hat. Blood on his knuckles.

He doesn't say anything at first.

He just **looks at her**-the girl who's carried a nation on her back, and finally stumbled.

---

She doesn't meet his gaze.  
Not until he speaks.

---

> "You did everything you could."

His voice is calm.

> "You did more than anyone else ever would."

She looks up, barely able to lift her head.

> "...But I didn't stop it."

> "I couldn't stop *him*..."

---

Luffy crouches down.

Not beside her.

**In front of her.**

So she has to look him in the eye.

---

> "You're not supposed to."

He pulls his hat low, letting the shadow fall over his eyes.

> "*I'm gonna stop him.*"

---

She blinks.

> "What...?"

---

He stands again, facing the rooftop.

Facing **Crocodile.**

> "You asked us for help."

> "Now let us do it."

---

He cracks his neck once.

Sand rises. The sky dims.

Crocodile is **raising a second storm**, large enough to **devour the plaza**.

---

> "You rest now."

> "We fight."

---

And then he's gone-**leaping upward**, fists clenched, hurtling toward the storm.

---

**OOC: Luffy is en route to Crocodile.  
Vivi is still on the ground, stunned-but a spark flickers. A weight is lifted.  
She finally let someone else carry the burden.**

---

**Meanwhile...**

Back in an alleyway, **a tired, dusty schoolteacher** blinks slowly from the floor, ribs aching.

Somewhere in the distance, **thunder rumbles**.

You grunt softly.

> "...Sounds like someone woke the brat up."

You don't move.

Not yet.

But the **air pressure is changing.**

---

Would you like to transition to Luffy's confrontation with Crocodile?  
Or let Eatone start crawling his way back to relevance?

>> USER: Groan. I gotta get moving. Can't let some children show me up. Not after everything I said.

I flex my muscles experimentally - no dice. Instead, I conjure a thin film of kiwi juice in front of me, and will it to turn into a stream. Like a greased pig, I start slithering my way down the cobblestone towards the plaza.

OOC: Where is Tashigi?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Alleyways - Slither of Determination]**  
**Scene: "The Kiwi-Crawl of Shame"**  
**Tone: Equal Parts Heroic and Ridiculous | Mood: Determined Desperation**

---

You groan.

The kind of groan that says: *I'm not done, I'm just disgusted by how little gas is left in the tank.*

> "Can't let some children show me up. Not after everything I said..."

You brace your hands.

Muscles protest. Bones ache.

But you're awake.

You're angry.

You're **alive.**

---

So, you conjure a film of **sticky, citrus-slick kiwi juice** along the cobblestones.

It glistens faintly, trailing out ahead like a path forged by sheer, exhausted spite.

> "Okay. No walking. That's fine."

You take a breath.

And-

**SLURP.**

You begin **slithering** forward like a **greased-up, determined sea cucumber**, sliding through the dust like a tropical slug of justice.

---

It's not elegant.

It's not fast.

But damn it-it's **movement**.

---

**Meanwhile...**

### **Where Is Tashigi?**

**Status: Engaged in rooftop combat with Crocodile.**

---

Last seen, **Tashigi confronted Crocodile directly** on the palace rooftop while Vivi was collapsing below. She struck first-bold, clean, furious.

But she was **outmatched**.

Crocodile, amused and unhurried, struck her with a blast of sand, knocking her off her feet and sending her sliding across the roof's edge.

---

Right now:

- She's alive.
- She's wounded.
- But she's still standing.

She's buying time-her **sword clashes against his sand**, steel against storm-but every blow tells the same story.

> He's not fighting to kill her.  
> He's fighting to **prove how small she is**.

---

But she's holding.

For now.

Because someone else is coming.

---

**Luffy.**

---

He's rocketing toward the rooftop from the plaza floor, rubber limbs stretching as he **leaps from a building**, headed straight for the rising cyclone that Crocodile is now forming with a **casual flick of his fingers**.

---

The real fight is about to begin.

---

**OOC: Eatone is moving toward the battlefield at 0.0001 knots.  
Tashigi is wounded but active.  
Luffy is seconds from clashing with Crocodile.  
Vivi is recovering from emotional collapse-watching from below.**

Would you like to follow:
1. {Luffy vs. Crocodile, Round 1}  
2. {Tashigi's desperate retreat-or final stand}  
3. {Eatone, slithering with commentary}  
4. {Vivi's reaction to the storm that's about to start}

>> USER: Option 1 and 2.

I slowly start building momentum, my speed turning from beached seal to snake on crack

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Rooftop of Storms and Steel]**  
**Scene: "The Crocodile and the Rising Tide"**  
**Tone: Climactic | Mood: Outclassed but Not Outfought**

---

### **Part I: The Duel of the Doomed**

**Tashigi's boots scrape across cracked tile.**  
She's breathing hard, one eye nearly swollen shut, her blade trembling in her grip. Her coat is half-burned, sand caked into the fabric.

**Crocodile** looms at the far edge of the rooftop.  
King Cobra is slumped just behind him, barely conscious.  
And the air itself is **twisting** with heat and pressure, sand circling the Warlord like a divine curse.

---

> "Still standing?" Crocodile says, voice dripping arrogance. "Hmph. Admirable. But pointless."

> "You're not the one I want."

> "You're just here to fill the silence."

---

**Tashigi lunges.**

Her sword gleams in the orange glow of the desert light.  
A clean, practiced thrust-aimed for his throat.

---

But Crocodile doesn't move.

Instead-**his chest dissolves into sand**, the blade sliding through him like a stick through smoke.

> "Ah ah," he chuckles.  
> "You should've studied harder."

---

**Slam.**

His arm turns into a **twisting hook of solid sand**, and **he backhands her** across the rooftop.

She *flies* into the palace's stone ledge, gasping for air, her sword spinning from her grip.

---

She coughs, curls one arm over her ribs.  
Her teeth are gritted.

But she's still alive.

Still trying to rise.

---

And then-

---
