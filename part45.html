>> USER: Gah, I need to keep him down!  I prepare another glob of juice, willing it to be stickier. It turns yellowish. Doubly odd.

(OOC: this is the most life and death Eatone has ever faced. Precious bounties often involved small time bandits or weak pirates. Not a grand line warlord and his criminal syndicate)

Option 3 - Looks like no backup is forthcoming, the others are engaged. You able to fight, blue?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River Skirmish - Stick, Don't Slip]**  
**Tone: Desperate Focus | Mood: Evolution Under Pressure**

---

> *Gah-I need to keep him down!*

Your hand trembles slightly as you call more juice to the surface.  
Not just **more**-but *different*.

> "Stickier," you mutter under your breath. "I need this bastard *grounded.*"

It comes willingly.

A **glob** of kiwi concentrate, thicker than jam and slightly **yellowish**, oozes across your palm with a viscosity you haven't summoned before.

> *This... isn't just juice. This is control.*

You feel it now-your Devil Fruit is **responding to stress, to survival**, to your *need* to protect.

---

Bon Clay is already trying to recover.

> "*You cowardly cocktail!*"  
He stumbles upright, blinded but dramatically posturing again.  
> "*I shall unleash my encore-!*"

You don't give him the chance.

With a flick of your wrist, you hurl the sticky glob with precision.

> *SPLAT!*

Right into his **leg and hip**.

He slams to the ground with a shriek of dramatic betrayal, one leg **glued to the sand**, the other flailing wildly like a panicked flamingo in a dance-off against gravity.

> "*I CAN'T MOVE! WHO TRAPS A DANCER'S LEG?!*"

---

But even as he writhes, the battle rages around you.

You glance over your shoulder.

> **Zoro** is toe-to-toe with Mr. 1 now-blades sparking like lightning against iron.  
> **Nami** has conjured cloud cover. Thunder rumbles above.  
> **Luffy** is locked in a headbutt war with a Baroque enforcer shaped like a hay bale.  
> **Tashigi** is holding her own-but she's wounded.  
> **Chopper's Guard Point** is under pressure.  
> **Usopp's screaming. That's normal.**

No one's coming to help.

---

You turn to **Vivi**.

> "You able to fight, Blue?"

She startles slightly at the question.

> "I-yes. I've trained. I'm not just here to hide."

She reaches beneath her cloak and draws two slender **peacock-slashers**-steel-bladed rings strung with retractable wires.

Her stance isn't perfect.

But it's **determined.**

> "Just tell me who. And when."

---

**OOC Ability Note:**
- New sub-manifestation unlocked: **Stickiness Control.** You can now manipulate **adhesive properties** of your juice.  
- The **yellowish tone** appears to correspond with this trait.  
- You're under real life-and-death pressure now-and your Fruit is evolving as you adapt.

---

**Bon Clay is currently stuck, blinded, flailing.  
Vivi is at your side.**

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Together, you and Vivi move in to finish Bon Clay before he recovers.}  
2. {Tell Vivi to hold the line-then break off to help Tashigi or another ally.}  
3. {Keep Vivi guarded. Don't engage until Bon Clay tries to transform-you're watching for it.}  
4. {Start controlling battlefield space-layer sticky and slippery zones for control.}  
5. {Encourage Vivi to strike first. Test her readiness. Watch her back.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 3 - Can't go finish Bon Clay off, I'd be leaving Vivi unguarded.

I lick a bit of the yellower juice left on my fingertips. Huh. Sweet. Squint.

Is this... Like... Sweet golden kiwis vs tart green kiwis? What the heck?!

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River Skirmish - Kiwi Awakening]**  
**Tone: Tactical Pause | Mood: Confused Discoveries Under Fire**

---

Bon Clay is still flailing in the sand, **dramatically trapped**, and crying out like he's performing to an invisible opera house.

> "*This is a CRIME AGAINST PERFORMANCE ART-*!"

You don't flinch.

You don't move.

> Because **Vivi's behind you**.

And no matter how tempting it is to walk over and beat that man into a sticky citrus pancake, you're not letting her get blindsided while you showboat.

---

You hold position. **Eyes forward. Juice ready.**  
Bon Clay isn't out of tricks yet. You've seen the flair, but not the **Devil Fruit**-and *something* tells you he's not done.

---

As the sticky mist drips from your fingers, you absently swipe your thumb across your palm and bring it to your tongue-

Just a taste.

> *Sweet.*

Your brow furrows.

You glance at the faint **yellow smear** still coating your skin.

> "Huh..."

You squint at the glob still sticking Bon Clay's leg to the sand.

It's glistening slightly **golden.**

> *This isn't the usual green...*

You look to the earlier splotch from the acidic blast-

**Bright green. Sharp. Sour.**

But *this*?  
This is **sweeter**, richer, with a honeyed aftertaste.

---

You blink, trying to process what your instincts already know.

> **Golden kiwis.**  
Not just sweet, but **different in effect**.  
Your body isn't just manipulating juice.

It's calling on different **types**.

And possibly different **properties.**

---

> *"Green for sour, sharp, acidic..."*  
> *"Gold for sticky, sweet... adhesive?"*

You're not just conjuring kiwi juice anymore.  
You're **selecting varietals**.

Like a goddamn fruit sommelier of violence.

---

**Vivi notices your squint.**  
> "Something wrong?"

You murmur:

> "I think I've been using this fruit like a faucet.  
Turns out it's more like a... juice bar."

She doesn't understand the metaphor.

But she does grin a little.

> "You're weird."

---

Bon Clay lets out a screech.

> "*And now my eyes are back! I SEE YOU, JUICE KNAVE! I-OH NO WAIT I'M STILL STUCK-*"

---

**OOC Update:**

You now understand your Devil Fruit has **distinct kiwi variants** with unique traits.

- **Green Kiwi**: Tart, acidic, reactive. Sharp burst attacks and mist.
- **Golden Kiwi**: Sweet, thick, adhesive. Trapping and binding.
- More varietals may emerge based on **emotional state**, **intention**, or **environmental stimuli**.

---

**You are holding the line. Vivi's safe. Bon Clay is immobilized (for now).**

---

**What's your next move?**

1. {Prep a second layer of golden kiwi to restrain him further if he tries to transform.}  
2. {Test your control-try conjuring a different effect on purpose. Think "cooling" or "stinging."}  
3. {Quietly tell Vivi to ready her weapons-you'll give her the opening if Bon Clay breaks free.}  
4. {Call out to the crew: "Bon's stuck! Someone take him out!"}  
5. {Keep watching. Still and ready. You're not taking your eye off this freak for a second.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 4 - Oi, someone get the pink guy! I get a little closer to Vivi

OOC: the others are still fully engaged. Some may be faltering.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River Skirmish - Tactical Yelling]**  
**Tone: Controlled Panic | Mood: Guarded, Under Pressure**

---

You hold your ground-juice at the ready, baton steady-but your eye flicks to the side.

> **Bon Clay's not down for long.**  
The man is many things-loud, dramatic, unnerving-but above all?  
**Resilient.**

You raise your voice, slicing through the cacophony of sand, steel, and chaos.

> "*OI! Someone get the pink guy!*"

Your voice cracks like a school bell through a brawl.

---

But the response?

None.

- **Zoro's bleeding.**  
Fighting **Mr. 1**, and his blades aren't biting.  
- **Tashigi's backpedaling**, her shoulder cut-her blade catching, but her footing slipping.  
- **Luffy's mid-air**-fist drawn, roaring at some poor Baroque freak who looks like a potato with legs.  
- **Nami** is summoning lightning-but she's surrounded by two agents closing fast.  
- **Chopper** is shielding **Usopp**, who's now wildly yelling about "Phase Three of the Sniper King Plan."

> **Nobody's free.**

---

You glance back at **Vivi**.  
Her hands grip her peacock slashers tightly-knuckles white, jaw set.
