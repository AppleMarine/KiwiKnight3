<pre>ain resort entrance, you momentarily catch sight of **a small group of individuals slipping quietly down a side alley**. Their movements are quick, practiced-too deliberate for drunk tourists. One of them wears a **straw hat**. Another has a **long green sword at his hip**. A blue-nosed animal waddles behind them wearing a backpack.

You blink, but they vanish behind a corner. No one else seems to notice-or care.

**LOCATION: Rainbase - Entry Plaza**
- **Rain Dinners Main Gate**: A wide arch flanked by lavish fountains spewing mist into the air. A **lounge singer** croons an Alabastan jazz melody from a stage inside the lobby.
- **Side Alley (Just Passed)**: The figures went this way. Dimly lit, partially blocked by crates.
- **Canal Boardwalk**: Leads to merchant ships and shady taverns. The rain glimmers on the cobblestones.
- **Observation Gator Tower**: A tourist attraction-ride a Banana Gator-shaped elevator up to see the desert!
- **Local Bounty Board**: Near a post office, tucked between ads for sand lotion and drink coupons.

---

**You are wearing:**
- A light tan jacket (sleeves rolled up), slacks, and comfortable sandals.
- Over one shoulder, a cross-body bag with bounty hunter credentials tucked *behind* your teacher ID.

**You are carrying:**
- A reusable juice canteen
- A compact bounty hunter's Den Den Mushi (off)
- Some extra cash, drink tickets, and Rain Dinners coupons
- A small teaching notebook with lessons half-scribbled on heatstroke prevention and desert ecosystem ecology

**What would you like to do?**

1. {Keep walking toward Rain Dinners, play the oblivious tourist, and enjoy a free fruit cocktail.}
2. {Head down the alley to see what the mysterious group is doing-it could be nothing, or it could be a juicy lead.}
3. {Stop by the bounty board. See if there's any easy, low-risk bounties to nab while on "vacation."}
4. {Use a discreet Kiwi Juice probe technique (a spritz under the soles of your feet to stealthily track moisture trails) to follow the group without being noticed.}
5. {Do something completely idiotic but potentially brilliant: step up onto a table and loudly call out, "HEY! IS THAT A TALKING DEER?"}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 2 - Eh...? As a frequent traveler, I know the best sights are often off the beaten path. Perhaps they're heading towards a little-known hole-in-the-wall kebab place.

OOC: My main weapon is an expandable baton with a Seastone tip, purchased tearfully after many months of saved teacher's wages.

>> ASSISTANT: **ðŸŽ² Action Selected: Option 2 - "Eh...? Could be a kebab spot."**  
**ðŸ’¬ Passive Ability Activated: Responsible Adult Instinct - *"That group looked like they were up to something... or maybe just hungry. I should at least check it out. Quietly."***  
**ðŸ§ƒ Equipment Updated: Expandable Seastone Baton - Carried in an inner pocket of your travel jacket.**

**LOCATION SHIFT: Rainbase - Side Alley Behind the Glitter**

The main promenade fades behind you as you slip off the main path and into the **side alley**, the brightness of the desert sun giving way to half-shadow and filtered light bouncing off stacked crates of casino supplies-**fake coins, glittery feather boas, barrels of juice syrup (some inferior imposter Kiwi, you note with disdain)**.

Your sandals crunch over discarded betting slips and spice wrappers. The alley narrows, curving gently, eventually opening onto a **forgotten street** behind the Rain Dinners compound-one only **locals or sneak-savvy veterans** would know about. There's a single rusty lantern hung from a bent pole above the archway, fluttering with paper ads in Alabastan script: **"Wanted: Delivery Boy - Must Not Ask Questions."**

Ahead, you catch them again-**that same group**, slipping silently past a **caged Banana Gator pen**, now moving even more cautiously. One figure-a short woman with tangerine-colored hair and a confident stride-turns briefly and scans the area. You freeze behind a crate, holding your breath. She seems to look right through you... then keeps moving.

Their body language is telling:
- The **swordsman** is keeping rear guard.
- The **blue-nosed reindeer** has changed shape-now walking upright like a human, muttering nervously.
- The **young man in the straw hat** is walking up front, arms crossed, looking fired up, but oddly... hungry.

They clearly don't want to be seen. And they definitely aren't tourists.

You edge closer, one hand brushing your coat pocket, resting over the cool, weighty feel of your **Seastone Baton**, just in case.

Then-**a whisper, from behind you.**

> "Yo. You new in town too, musclehead-sensei?"

You spin.

A figure leans against the alley wall, half-hidden by shadow. A man dressed flamboyantly in a pink-and-blue swan coat, **dancer's slippers** on his feet, and heavy makeup around his eyes.

He bows-dramatically.

> "**Mr. 2 Bon Clay, at your fabulous service!** Don't mind me, just people-watching. Funny thing about people... they're so good at sneaking but *so bad at hiding!* Teehee!"

His eyes narrow. He tilts his head, lips pursed like he's holding back something *juicy*.

> "And here you are, little sidewinder. Out of uniform, off the books, and in the thick of the biggest party in the kingdom. Curious~. Say... who're you here to see?"

You get the feeling this guy *knows more than he's saying.* He's testing you. Flamboyant, but no fool.

**NPC Engaged: Mr. 2 Bon Clay**  
**Known Traits: Clone-Clone Fruit user, deceptive, flamboyant, unpredictable**  
**Hidden Traits: ???**  
**Secret: He is observing the Straw Hats under Crocodile's orders-but might not be entirely loyal to Crocodile's cause.**

**Time: Late Afternoon**  
**Weather: Cooling slightly; breeze from the canal picking up dust**

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Feign ignorance. "Just sightseeing. Is this where the kebab place is?" Play dumb and extract info from Bon Clay.}
2. {Pretend to know who he is, butter him up, and ask if he's heading to Rain Dinners. Try to get him talking.}
3. {Casually mention the group you saw, see how he reacts. Risky, but might give you leverage.}
4. {Politely excuse yourself and try to tail the group further. Might require stealth check.}
5. {Lie. Tell him you're undercover security from the resort. Roll to bluff.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option X - You... you know me? I look him up and down. Are you one of the parents of my kids? I pull out my notebook and ruffle through the class roster, looking for someone with the last name of 'Clay'

(Honest)

OOC: I teach at a school in another Kingdom, also in the Grand Line.

>> ASSISTANT: **ðŸŽ² Action Selected: Option X - Honest Confusion**  
**ðŸŽ­ Social Check: Honesty vs. Suspicion**  
**(Rolling for Mr. 2 Bon Clay's Insight - result: 4 on the ladder [Fair])**  
**(Rolling for Eatone's Honesty + Role as Teacher - result: 6 on the ladder [Great])**  
**âœ… Outcome: SUCCESS - Bon Clay is caught off guard.**

The alley hangs in a moment of awkward stillness.

You tilt your head, expression *genuinely confused*, squinting at the theatrical man with a look halfway between recognition and concern.

> "You... you know me?"

You begin rummaging through your **notebook**, flipping past diagrams of sandstorms and a half-sketched kiwi juice cooling system. Bon Clay blinks as you scan page after page of rosters, class projects, and notes written in your tiny, educator's handwriting.

> "Are you... one of the parents of my kids?" you ask, eyes flicking up. "Wait-Clay, Clay, Clay... no... Clancy? Clive? Clarence..."

You trace a finger down the list like you're doing a parent-teacher conference audit.

Bon Clay's jaw slackens ever so slightly. His posture wavers. It's the kind of deeply disarming honesty that hits with the subtlety of a cannonball made of awkwardness.

> "Whaaat-!? PFFFT-AHAHA! *What even is this?!* You're not bluffing? You're seriously just some nobody schoolteacher? Bounty hunter-slash-teacher? What is this, a </pre>
