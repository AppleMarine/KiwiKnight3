<pre>de you, **Vivi lets out an exhale**-somewhere between a laugh and a sigh.

> "Sorry," she says with just enough amusement to twist the knife,  
> "It's a one-way ticket. Straight to Alubarna."

A pause.

> "Then into a civil war."

She turns her head toward you, eyebrow raised slightly.

> "Still flipping?"

---

Your ribs throb.  
Your skin itches.  
You're fairly sure a mole-woman tried to tunnel through your liver.

And now you're riding a noble desert waterfowl into a city-sized disaster.

---

Far ahead, **smoke curls into the sky.**

Alubarna's silhouette cuts jagged against the horizon.

---

**OOC: Your situation-**  
- You are alive.  
- You are recovering.  
- You are **en route to the final stand**.

And everyone-Vivi, Tashigi, the Straw Hats-knows that **without you**, Vivi wouldn't be here to see it.

---

Would you like to say something else to Vivi?  
Rest?  
Plan your "accidental" duck detour?

ðŸŒ€ {Your move.}

>> USER: I give a tired, baleful gaze to Vivi. You're bringing me to what

>> ASSISTANT: **[Desert Crossing - The Betrayal of Geography]**  
**Scene: "The Look That Could Curdle Juice"**  
**Tone: Wry Despair | Mood: A Teacher's Worst Field Trip**

---

You slowly, **painfully** rotate your head to face Vivi.

You squint at her through bruised eyes like a disappointed substitute teacher who just found out the class has *absolutely* not been doing the assigned reading.

> *"You're bringing me to... what."*

Not even a question.  
A quiet accusation.

The look says:

> *I took cannon fire for you.*  
> *I conjured a juice demon.*  
> *And you're taking me WHERE?*

---

Vivi doesn't flinch.

She meets your gaze. Calm. Straight-backed. Regal even now, with a fraying bandage and wind-tangled hair.

> "Alubarna."

> "To stop a civil war."

A pause.

> "And possibly a Warlord."

Another pause.

> "...But we have ducks."

She gestures lightly around you as **the Squad flaps forward in dramatic V-formation**, looking like the world's most well-organized avian cavalry unit.

---

You stare.

Blank.

Utter silence.

Then:

> "Fantastic."

You slouch so hard you nearly fall off Cruller.

---

> "...Do the ducks get hazard pay?" you mumble.

---

Vivi cracks-just a little. The corners of her lips lift. Almost.

> "They're volunteers."

You groan.

---

**OOC:**  
You are now fully awake, if not fully recovered.  
You are en route to **Alubarna**-and the **final confrontation** of the Alabasta arc.  
The mood is light for the moment... but the city ahead?  
Not so much.

Would you like to continue light banter, talk serious strategy with Vivi... or rejoin the Straw Hats for the final leg of the journey?

>> USER: Is it too late to ask for you to drop me off at the nearest... Literally Anywhere else? I moan

>> ASSISTANT: **[Desert Crossing - Denial is a Valid Coping Mechanism]**  
**Scene: "The Last Exit Closed 500 Miles Ago"**  
**Tone: Deadpan Comedy | Mood: Resigned March Toward Destiny**

---

You lean back in the saddle, one arm dangling uselessly over the side of Cruller, the duck gently jostling you with every step. Your voice comes out in a half-moan, half-groan-less a statement and more a **plea to any higher being who accepts exhausted resignation as prayer.**

> "Is it too late to ask for you to drop me off at the nearest...  
literally *anywhere else*?"

---

**Vivi**, still holding the reins with cool composure, doesn't look at you.

She just replies, dry as a desert creekbed:

> "We passed â€˜Anywhere Else' about three days ago."

She tilts her head toward the rising towers of **Alubarna** in the distance.

> "Next stop is: imminent chaos, possible assassination attempts, and maybe ancient world-shaking secrets buried in catacombs."

A beat.

> "Would you prefer a snack before we arrive?"

---

Behind you, **Usopp coughs loudly.**

> "I'd like to get off at the snack stop too."

**Sanji:** "No one's stopping, *cowards*!"

---

**Cruller the Duck quacks judgmentally at you.**  
His eyes say *You knew what this was.*

---

Vivi glances at you again, and this time... she gives a small, genuine smile.

> "You can still run."

Her tone is teasing.

But her eyes?

They're searching.

Maybe hoping you won't.

---

**OOC: This is your final opportunity to pull away, delay your involvement, or commit fully to the Alubarna climax.  
Whether out of justice, guilt, affection-or stubborn fruit-fueled martyrdom.**

How do you respond?

>> USER: I close my eyes. I'll think about it, blue.

Zoro notices that "pineapple" is awake

>> ASSISTANT: **[Desert Crossing - Nearing Alubarna]**  
**Scene: "One Last Quiet Before the Storm"**  
**Tone: Contemplative | Mood: Pressure Mounting Beneath Banter**

---

You close your eyes again. Not out of exhaustion this time, but sheer *emotional bandwidth overload*. There's only so much heroism a man can process before he starts charging union dues for it.

> "I'll think about it, Blue..."

Your voice is quiet. Tired. Honest.

---

Vivi doesn't answer.

But she **nods**, just slightly.  
And she doesn't press you.

She just holds the reins, keeping the duck steady, **letting the silence stretch** like a classroom between bell rings.

---

Somewhere off to your left, another duck flaps its wings aggressively.

You hear a familiar grunt:

> "He's awake."

**Zoro.**

Riding his own duck-ungracefully, of course-squinting over the dunes.

He shouts across the wind:

> "Oi! Pineapple! Took you long enough!"

A beat.

> "Was worried we'd have to prop you up in front of the Warlord Weekend Sale."

---

There's the sound of **Sanji yelling something profane** back at Zoro about "his sense of humor dying before his brain ever did," followed by duck-quacking, likely in solidarity with *you*.

---

**Nami** leans back on her duck two rows ahead and calls over her shoulder:

> "Glad to see you're not dead. Don't do that again."

---

**Luffy**, riding up beside you, smiles wide:

> "Hey! You missed lunch!"

Then, after a pause:

> "...Also, we're maybe fighting a sand monster later. Not sure yet. Depends."

---

**Vivi** sighs softly, brushing some wind-tossed hair from her face.

> "Welcome back."

---

The city grows larger on the horizon.

The final arc is beginning.

But for now-just for a minute-you're among allies.

Even if you're still thinking about where the nearest duck-only exit might be.

---

**OOC: You're in.  
Welcome to the Alubarna Finale.**  
Would you like to remain quiet as you approach, chat with the crew, or prepare in your own way?

>> USER: I yell angrily, where the hell did pineapple come from? I don't even look like one! Call me sensei or something, you brat!

Tashigi notices my awakening

>> ASSISTANT: **[Approaching Alubarna - The Final Stretch]**  
**Scene: "Not a Pineapple"**  
**Tone: Irritated Teacher Energy | Mood: Tired, Roasted, Still Trying to Command Respect**

---

You snap upright as much as your bruised spine will allow, eyes bloodshot, hair wind-tossed, and bandages flapping like surrender flags.

> "WHERE THE HELL DID *PINEAPPLE* COME FROM?!"

The desert echoes with your fury as even Cruller the duck flinches under you.

> "I don't even look like one! You see any leaves on my head, *mosshead?!*"

Zoro doesn't look back. But his smirk could be seen from orbit.

> "Wasn't the hair. It's the juice."

You slap your hand over your face, wincing as you graze a bruise.

> "Call me *sensei* or something, you little brat! I'm ten years older than most of you!"

Luffy, from two ducks over:

> "You're ten years *older*?!"

**Usopp** gasps as if discovering ancient forbidden knowledge.

> "He's ancient!"

**Nami:** "You act like you're sixty."

**Sanji:** "Tsk. Still more maturity than Marimo over there."

**Zoro:** "Still bleeds like a rookie."

---

**Tashigi**, riding just ahead of you and Vivi, finally turns, eyebrow raised over her glasses.

She's not smiling.

Not exactly.

But the way her lips twitch tells you she's been listening the entire time.

She sees you awake.

She sees the gri</pre>
