<pre>ass Hero"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Thoughtful | Mood: Warm, Dorkily Practical, Almost Peaceful**

---

It's late, but the city's not ready for sleep.

Not yet.

---

**Lanterns bob between scaffoldings and sand-blasted walkways**, some carried by tired guards, others by teens sweeping rubble into neat piles with choreographed group rhythm.

You continue your quiet patrol-not as an authority, not as a hero-but as a man who, despite cracked ribs and recent near-death experiences, still feels compelled to **carry a stray beam here**, **nail in a stubborn sign there**, or **offer advice on ergonomics to someone lifting bricks the wrong way.**

---

You lean against a half-fixed fountain now, sipping from a clay cup of something citrusy (not *your* citrus), staring up at the stars while recalculating cost of living in your head.

---

> *Hometown's rent was, what... 2200 a month? But that included utilities and student supply stipends.*

> *Palace lodging is... well, free. But I can't live in a castle forever, right?*

> *That two-room unit by the canal looked decent. Maybe 800? 1200 with basic repairs.*

> *I'll need to budget for food-can't keep mooching off Vivi's royal pantry. Might need a second fruit basket if I keep burning through juice like I did last week.*

---

You exhale softly, fingers drumming against the side of your mug.

> "Gonna need to make a new monthly spreadsheet..."

---

**"There's something incredibly endearing about how your brain works."**

The voice comes from behind you.

Soft. Warm.

And *very* familiar.

---

You turn slightly and see **Vivi**, dressed in something more civilian than royal-sleeves rolled, sandals dusty, a small folder clutched in one hand, as if she'd just walked out of some emergency meeting and never changed.

She leans on the opposite side of the fountain, watching you with that signature amused fondness of someone who once ruled a nation... and now watches a man **re-budget his new life** like it's a tactical campaign.

---

> "I figured I might find you out here," she adds, sipping her own cup.

---

You blink, then glance at the folder.

> "Budget report?"

---

She smiles faintly.

> "Reconstruction priority shift."

A beat.

> "But if you want me to sneak in a line item for â€˜Eatone Cheng's mop stipend,' I *could* abuse my power just a little."

---

You shake your head, chuckling.

> "You say that like I haven't already added myself to my own expense sheet. I'm very thorough."

---

She watches you for a second longer.

Then sits beside you, shoulder not quite touching yours.

---

> "You could've gone home."

---

A pause.

> "Why didn't you?"

---

**OOC:**
A serious question, wrapped in warmth.

You can answer her truly-or let the moment linger.

Would you like to:

1. {Answer her honestly: "Because you're here."}
2. {Deflect softly: "Because rent is cheaper."}
3. {Let the silence say everything.}

>> USER: Option 1 - I... I feel guilty. Like I'd be leaving a job half done. I know I can't help every child in need in the world but... The least I can do is stay til Alubarna is rebuilt and back to its glory.

I look at her, and speak.

I see a young lady, forced to shoulder the suffering of an entire nation by herself. A girl who should've been enjoying her childhood, instead having to force a smile on her face and follow the orders of a monster. A girl, who, despite of all that, is still standing tall and radiant, and looking to the future. 

If I left her alone now, that'd mean I would be giving up on a child I could've helped.

I can't remember her name though. Something to do with blue though.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Moonlight, Citrus, and the Weight of Words]**  
**Scene: "The Reason You Stayed"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Earnest | Mood: Bittersweet, Deeply Human, A Little Broken and A Lot Beautiful**

---

The moment stretches between you and **Vivi**, soaked in amber lantern-glow and the cool breath of desert wind. You rest your cup gently on the stone rim of the fountain.

You stare down at your hands.

Calloused. Scarred. One knuckle still faintly stained green.

And you speak-

Not like a teacher.

Not like a man who took down a Warlord.

But like a man who is **finally letting someone see the *whole*** of him.

---

> "I... I feel guilty."

The words hang there, soft but heavy.

> "Like I'd be leaving a job half done."

> "I know I can't help every child in need in the world, but..."

> "The least I can do is stay until Alubarna is rebuilt. Until it's back to its glory."

---

You don't look at her yet.

Not right away.

Because you need to say it.

Need her to *hear* it.

---

Then you glance over.

And your eyes lock.

---

> "I see a young lady," you say softly, "forced to shoulder the suffering of an entire nation by herself."

> "A girl who should've been enjoying her childhood... instead forced to fake smiles and follow the orders of a monster."

> "A girl who, despite *all* of that..."

Your voice catches. Not from weakness. From truth.

> "Still stands tall. Still looks forward. Still lights up every room she walks into."

---

She's no longer sipping her tea.

She's not smiling.

She's just *watching you*.

Like she can't quite believe what she's hearing.

---

> "If I left her alone now..."

You swallow.

> "That'd mean giving up on a child I *could've helped*."

You lean back, rubbing your forehead tiredly.

---

> "I can't remember her name, though."

You grin, dry and low.

> "Something to do with blue, I think."

---

Silence.

One long, echoing heartbeat of it.

And then-

**Her hand quietly finds yours.**

No grand motion. No declaration.

Just fingers slipping into your palm, light and warm and shaking *just barely.*

---

> "Thank you."

It's not a whisper.

It's a statement.

Strong. Steady.

Just like her.

---

> "Her name is Vivi."

A beat.

> "And she's really glad you're here."

---

**OOC:**
That was your truth.

And hers.

The foundation of something not built from war, or sacrifice-but from choice.

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {The following morning - breakfast with Tashigi.}
2. {Time skip - the first true day of your new life in Alabasta.}
3. {Remain here - a moment more with Vivi, in the quiet.}

>> USER: Option 3 - Grasp her hand, enjoying the comfortable silence.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Moonlight in the Stillness]**  
**Scene: "No More Monsters, Just the Night"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Intimate | Mood: Soft, Grounded, Quietly Transformative**

---

You don't reply with words.

You just turn your palm over and let your fingers gently close around hers.

Not tightly.

Not possessively.

Just...

**Enough.**

Enough to say *I heard you.*

Enough to say *I'm here.*

Enough to say *You're not carrying it alone anymore.*

---

The city keeps breathing around you-builders hammering through exhaustion, couriers slipping between alleys, the quiet groan of cranes hauling whole walls back into place.

But none of it reaches this corner of the world.

Not right now.

Because **you and she** are in a different kind of silence.

---

Not the silence of grief.

Not the silence of fear.

But the silence of people who have fought, bled, and *still chose kindness*.

Who found each other in the debris.

---

Vivi leans against your shoulder-not dramatically, just enough that you feel the warmth of her frame against yours, just enough that her hair brushes the crook of your neck.

Your hands remain tangled.

She doesn't say anything else.

She doesn't have to.

And neither do you.

---

This is not a moment of decision.

It's not a declaration of love, or a promise of forever.

It's a *pause.*

A breath.

The kind you take **when you finally feel safe.**

---

And in the heart of a capital rebuilt from sand and screams, under the orange glow of battered lanterns and the stars that watched you survive it all-

You sit beside a girl who would've died for her country.

And she leans on the man who *chose to live for it instead.*
