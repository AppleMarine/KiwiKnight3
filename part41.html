<pre>words of leaving had on Vivi and Tashigi.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Desert Skiff - Playing With Fruit and the Future]**  
**Tone: Gentle Humor | Mood: A Moment of Sweetness in the Rising Storm**

---

Chopper's nose twitches in his sleep.

You raise two fingers again.

> *Pftt.*

A soft arc of juice flicks from your fingertips into the little reindeer's open mouth.

He smacks his lips. Blinks awake.

> "Mmm? Hey... that one was *good!*"

He sits up, tail wiggling.

> "It was *sweeter!* Kind of like... kiwi mixed with honey? That was awesome!"

You blink.

Huh.

You didn't exactly try to sweeten it.  
But you did *wish* for it.

> **And it happened.**

You glance at your fingertips. The juice left behind has a faint **yellow tinge**-brighter than usual. A little more golden.

You mutter to yourself.

> "Huh. Why didn't I do that last time?"

---

Chopper is now enthusiastically bouncing in place.

> "Do it again! Juice me again!"

**Nami** raises an eyebrow from the side. "Are we just handing out sugar shots now?"

**Usopp** starts whispering, "Kiwi-Kiwi-no-Juice: Form One... Reindeer Delight Beam..."

**Zoro**, low under his breath: "This is what you get when a fruit user is also a teacher."

---

You shake your hand off, watching the citrus droplets flick away. Something about the taste, the color-it responded to how you felt.

> *Could your juice shift in flavor? Mood? Intent?*

Something to consider.

---

**Unseen by you:**

**Vivi**, watching Chopper's reaction, smiles. A real one. For just a moment.

Then her eyes drop. The smile fades.

She's thinking about what you said.  
About leaving.

---

**Tashigi**, facing forward now, is still quiet. Still pretending not to listen.

But her posture's rigid. Her grip, too tight.

She didn't miss the juice.  
Or the shift.  
Or the words before it.

---

**OOC Status:**

- You are still unaware of the emotional ripple your plans to leave have caused.  
- Your Devil Fruit power is evolving subtly-*emotion- or intent-based variation is now hinted*.  
- You have defused the moment with humor, for now.  
- The skiff nears the **Sandora River crossing**, the next major strategic point-where Baroque Works may soon descend.

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Experiment. Try to create another juice with a specific flavor or color.}  
2. {Sit beside Chopper and answer his excited questions. Let the mood stay light.}  
3. {Finally address Vivi or Tashigi. Something feels... off.}  
4. {Take the reins and check the horizon. You've got a bad feeling about pursuit.}  
5. {Just breathe. Enjoy the calm while it lasts. You've earned it.}

ðŸŒ€ {Choose your action.}

>> USER: Option 3 - Go to Tashigi first. She still looks miserable for some reason. Perhaps she's worried about her CO still being stuck back in Rainbase.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Desert Skiff - Sandora Approach | Scene: The Guilt that Doesn't Speak]**  
**Tone: Subdued Concern | Mood: Hidden Guilt, Unspoken Fears**  

---

The wind howls across the open dunes, the **skiff tilting and cutting** over the golden sand. The sun glares above, distant but relentless. And through it all, **Tashigi hasn't moved.**

She sits rigid, sword balanced across her lap, one hand on the rudder crank, the other clenched so tight her knuckles are pale beneath the glove. Eyes forward. Unwavering.

But her shoulders...

> They speak volumes.

---

You step across the deck-quiet, steady-and stand near her. Not too close. Just enough to be heard over the wind.

She doesn't look at you.

You glance at her sidelong.

> "Still thinking about Smoker?"

A pause.

> "You've been stiff as a board since we left."

Another beat.

Then she answers, low, almost casual-**too** casual.

> "He's... not the type to go down easy.  
Even if Crocodile has him.  
He'll hold out."

But her voice isn't steady.

---

You nod slowly, gaze fixed on the sand ahead.

> "Well, you're not exactly all sunshine and daiquiris right now.  
If it's not him... what else is eating you?"

She finally looks at you.

Eyes sharp. Searching.

> "You said you're leaving. After this.  
Soon as we hit land."

Her voice isn't accusatory.  
It's **carefully neutral.**

> "Doesn't sit right."

---

You blink.

> "Well, yeah. That's the plan."

She looks away.

> "You stood between us and Crocodile's jaws.  
Saved the Straw Hats.  
Saved Vivi.  
And now that it's messy and *bigger than expected*, you're just going to vanish off the nearest liner?"

Her tone shifts, ever so slightly.

> "Just feels like we used you.  
And now we're gonna lose you."

---

There's silence for a moment-nothing but the **sound of the skiff's sails snapping**, the **grind of sand under hull**, and the distant **rush of the Sandora River drawing closer.**

She doesn't look at you again.

She just stares forward, jaw tight.

Waiting.

---

**You have a window to respond.**  
What do you say or do?

>> USER: I get confused.

Erm? What? What do you mean?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Desert Skiff - Nearing the Sandora | Scene: Misunderstood Guilt]**  
**Tone: Hesitant Vulnerability | Mood: Confusion, Cracks in the Armor**

---

You blink, frown, and tilt your head at her-honestly confused.

> "Erm? What? What do you mean?"

You were ready for worry about Smoker.  
Maybe a passing jab about the way you aim your juice.  
Not... this.

Not that tone.

Tashigi's eyes flick toward you.  
Then away again.

She exhales, shoulders falling slightly-like something slipped loose in her spine.

---

> "I mean..."

Her fingers tap the hilt of her sword.

> "You went *all in*. You didn't hesitate. You got covered in juice, clawed through a Warlord's deathtrap, nearly got eaten-*twice*-and you never once acted like it wasn't your responsibility."

She finally turns her head to you, brows furrowed-not in anger, but in something that looks a little like **disappointment**.

> "And now you're saying it didn't mean anything? That you're leaving the second it's safe?"

She shakes her head slightly.

> "I just... didn't expect that from you."

Her voice lowers.

> "And maybe I was wrong."

---

She doesn't look at you for a reaction.  
Doesn't ask anything outright.  
But her hands are trembling slightly on the rudder crank.

She's not just upset about Smoker.  
She's not just upset about you leaving.

She's wondering if she misjudged you.

And for someone like her?

That *hurts.*

---

**You have the floor.**  
You can backpedal.  
You can stand firm.  
You can confess.  
You can laugh it off.

How does Eatone Cheng answer this moment?

>> USER: I chuckle nervously. H-hey, I think i've survived plenty of near-death warlord encounters for one vacation. I'm no plucky princess or super marine. I'm just a guy. What difference would I really make?

>> ASSISTANT: **[Desert Skiff - Sandora River Winds | Scene: The Self-Deprecating Truth]**  
**Tone: Nervous Honesty | Mood: Cracked Armor, Misunderstood Modesty**

---

You chuckle-*nervously*, soft, like you're half-joking, half-deflecting.

> "H-hey... I think I've survived plenty of near-death Warlord encounters for *one* vacation, alright?"

You rub the back of your head, glancing away with a sheepish smirk.

> "I'm no plucky princess, or super Marine. I'm just a guy. Just a-what'd I say? Full-time kiwi juice man?"

You gesture vaguely at yourself, still splattered with traces of pulp and citrus stains.

> "What difference would I really make?"

---

Tashigi doesn't answer immediately.

Not with words.

Just a long stare, as if she's reading you more than listening to you.

---

> "You know..."

Her voice is calm now. Quiet.

> "That's the exact kind of thing Smoker would *hate* to hear."

You blink. She continues, eyes forward again.

> "He always says the most dangerous people in the world are the ones who think they *don't matter.*  
Because they fight like they've got nothing to lose.  
Because they throw themselves in for people who don't expect it.  
Because they *surprise everyone.*"

She looks at you again.

> "You surprised all of us."
