<pre> born yet. If you want to settle here, *you* tell *me* what you need."

---

You fumble for your notes.

> "Right-well, for starters: I'd like to register for **permanent residency**. I'd also like to be listed in the **tax system**-wouldn't want to be labeled a mooch."

Cobra raises an eyebrow.

> "You... *want* to pay taxes?"

You nod solemnly.

> "With great civic benefit comes great fiscal responsibility."

---

He stares at you for a beat too long.

Then slowly pulls a form from a drawer.

> "This one's for **residency status**. Includes optional medical coverage, palace contractor benefits, and local access to kebab subsidies."

> "Oh, and this one's the **employment affidavit**. We don't exactly have a checkbox for ‘fruit-based freelance hero'-but I can write in something like *‘Royal Reconstruction Consultant.'*"

You blink again.

> "That's... an actual job title?"

> "With salary," Cobra nods. "Standard for civic advisors and post-crisis morale liaisons."

> "With taxes," he adds, amused.

---

You take the pen with reverence.

> "I never thought signing a W-2 could feel so victorious."

---

**OOC: Administrative Victory Achieved!**  
You are now officially a **resident of Alubarna**, listed in the **Royal Tax & Census Registry** as a:

> **Royal Reconstruction Consultant (Provisional)**  
> Status: Civic Morale Liaison / Bounty Risk Triage Specialist  
> Compensation: Modest salary, subsidized housing (if needed), free kebab stand access on weekends.  

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Visit the palace clerk to submit the forms, then return to Tashigi.}  
2. {Swing by Vivi's office with your new official ID-perhaps show off a little.}  
3. {Take a stroll through the capital to let it all sink in.}

>> USER: ​Option 2 - Hey! Guess who got promoted from royal bum!

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Ministerial Wing, Vivi's Office]**  
**Scene: "Paperwork and Promotion Bragging Rights"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Playful | Mood: Earnest, Lighthearted Pride**

---

The **ministerial wing** of the palace is a very different flavor of regal-quieter, all **hushed sandal steps on polished stone**, interrupted only by the shuffling of papers, the scratching of pens, and the occasional nervous squeak of a junior scribe trying not to spill tea on century-old maps.

---

You wind through the corridors, forms neatly tucked under one arm and your new **Royal Reconstruction Consultant badge** glinting faintly on your chest-**laminated**, **official**, and **probably sticky-proof.**

You pass a guard who gives you a curious once-over.

You give him the slow nod of a man with taxpayer status and kebab rights.

---

**Vivi's door is open.**  
She's seated at a wide desk piled with more documents than one human should be expected to process in a lifetime.  
Her pen's in motion. Her brow's furrowed.

And when she hears your knock, she looks up with a tired smile.

> "Hey. What's up?"

You strike a pose.

Hands on hips. Badge prominently displayed.

> "Guess who just got promoted from royal bum to official palace staff."

---

She tilts her head.

Eyes dart to your badge.

Then back to you.

> "...Royal Reconstruction Consultant?"

You grin.

> "With kebab access. On weekends."

---

She laughs. It's short, but genuine.

Then rises, walks over, and gives your badge a little tap.

> "So you're official now, huh?"

> "Fully certified. Might even pay taxes someday."

> "Now you're just showing off."

You shrug.

> "Civic pride."

---

She pauses, expression softening.

> "I'm glad you're staying."

There's no teasing in her tone now. Just truth.

> "We need people like you."

---

You blink, a bit caught off guard.

> "You mean mildly injured, legally employed part-time fruit guys?"

> "Exactly those."

---

She returns to her desk, pulling out a small, slim folder from a drawer.  
The royal seal on the front is newer-drafted within the last day or two.

> "Since you're official now..." she says, placing it in your hands,  
> "I had this drawn up."

Inside is a **welcome packet**.  
Complete with:

- Your **official citizen code**  
- A map of **preferred vendor kebab stalls**  
- And-adorably-a **handwritten note** at the bottom:

> "Your school's lucky to have had you.  
> Alubarna is luckier now."

---

You stand there a moment too long.

Trying to figure out where to file that feeling in your heart.

Eventually you just nod, tuck the folder into your coat, and grin like a student who just passed a pop quiz without studying.

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Invite Vivi for a walk through the market-you're technically on duty now.}  
2. {Return to Tashigi and Smoker to report your change in status.}  
3. {Take the rest of the day slow. Find a rooftop. Watch the city.}

>> USER: ​Option 2 - Good luck with the paperwork, blue. Let me know if you need any pointers, I'm an expert at it.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Returning to the Marines]**  
**Scene: "Paper Cuts and Promotions"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Light | Mood: Professional Pride, Teasing Warmth**

---

> "Good luck with the paperwork, Blue," you say, slipping the folder into your coat and tossing her a little salute.  
> "Let me know if you need any pointers-after today, I'm basically an expert."

---

Vivi snorts softly behind you as you turn and head for the courtyard, her voice following like the dry wind of the desert:

> "Only if I want it covered in juice and filed under ‘improvised weaponry.'"

---

You grin to yourself the whole walk down the corridor.

---

A few turns later, you find yourself near the **Marine coordination center**, a converted wing of the palace where Smoker and Tashigi have set up temporary operations. Civil engineers and uniformed officers shuffle maps, clipboards, and casualty reports like chess pieces across the desert's aftershocks.

You spot **Tashigi**, already suited back up in her standard uniform, hair pinned tighter than usual. She looks up the moment you approach-eyes squinting.

> "You look smug."

You flash your new ID badge like a kid showing off a perfect test score.

> "I'm legitimate now. Fully-licensed. Kebab-access-verified."

She raises an eyebrow.

> "Congratulations. That means you're finally taxable."

> "My proudest moment."

---

Just then, **Smoker** steps out from one of the interior briefing rooms, lighting both cigars at once like a man actively trying to shorten his paperwork lifespan.

His eyes flick to you.

> "You file in with the civil side?"

You nod.

> "Royal Reconstruction Consultant."

> "Catchy," he mutters. "What, are you doing foundation checks with your juice powers?"

> "Only the *most foundational of responsibilities*, sir."

---

Smoker exhales twin streams of smoke and grumbles something about "damn freelancers infiltrating the chain of command."

He gestures toward the main desk, where a sealed envelope sits. It's heavy. Official.

> "Paperwork came in from Marine HQ," he says. "I was gonna tell her later-figured she was too busy clobbering civilians with wooden swords."

Tashigi's eyes narrow.

> "...Captain?"

Smoker offers the envelope with all the grace of a man offering someone a particularly stressful birthday gift.

> "**Congratulations, Ensign.** Effective immediately."

---

Tashigi blinks.

Then looks down at the envelope in her hand like it's warm to the touch.

> "You pulled rank with HQ?" she asks, voice low, almost disbelieving.

> "I put in a recommendation." He shrugs. "HQ agreed. You earned it. That's the job."

She looks a little stunned.

Just for a second.

Then glances your way-like she might want to pretend it's just a morning like any other.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Congratulate her respectfully-with some light teasing.}  
2. {Salute, dramatically. Maybe even bow. She deserves the moment.}  
3. {Play it cool, offer to buy her a kebab to celebrate. You *do* have official kebab privileges now.}

>> USER: ​Option 2 - well, we knew it was coming. Enjoy the moment regardless 

>> ASSISTANT: **[A</pre>
