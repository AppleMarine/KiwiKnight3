<pre>or my... tag-along."

> "With extra garlic," you add. "I want to repel any assassins with breath alone tonight."

> "Proactive defense."

He grunts. Begins flipping meat.

A few moments pass in the comfort of glowing coals and the soft buzz of nighttime Alubarna.

Children laugh from a nearby table.  
Someone plays a lute two streets over.  
You take a seat on a tilted crate and watch Tashigi as she exhales slowly, letting the tension roll off her like steam.

---

You murmur, half-sincere:

> "So is this your way of saying you care?"

She looks at you. Then hands you a wrapped skewer of blistered lamb and grilled dates.

> "This is my way of not listening to you complain on an empty stomach."

---

You both dig in.

And for a few minutes?

The world isn't broken.

The war is over.  
The kids are safe.  
The kebabs are perfect.

And somewhere in the distance, a fig seed rolls across a cobblestone.

**OOC: You've formed a new bond with Tashigi -**  
**"Sword & Citrus - A Comrade's Comfort"**

She won't say it aloud. But today?  
You were the right partner to have at her side.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Talk about anything deeper over the kebabs-loss, legacy, justice.}  
2. {Keep it light. Trade stories, maybe even smile.}  
3. {Just eat. In the quiet. Side by side. Let that be enough.}

>> USER: ​Option 2 - So, what's your CO up to these days? Any new orders coming in from HQ? 

OOC: Smoker is leading reconstruction from the Marine side. He has also received word that he's getting a promotion to Commodore for "single handedly saving Alabasta from Crocodile", as said in the news - something he's angrily trying to correct the record on. Secretly, he's also put in a request to promote Tashigi to Ensign and got it approved, something he plans to surprise her with at the next opportunity.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Artisan Quarter, Late Evening]**  
**Scene: "The Captain, The Promotion, and The Skewers"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Light with Subtext | Mood: Comfortable, Friendly, Just a Touch of Warmth**

You're two bites into the most absurdly well-spiced lamb skewer of your life when you tilt your head Tashigi's way, grease on your fingers, a trace of smoke still curling from the kebab stand behind you.

> "So... what's your CO up to these days?"

You say it casually-like you're asking about the weather. But she stiffens slightly. Not tension exactly, just... formality. Even in kebab mode.

> "Any new orders coming in from HQ?"

---

Tashigi takes a moment to chew, swallows, then dabs the corner of her mouth with the inside of her glove.  
Because she's Tashigi, and of course she does.

> "Captain Smoker's been working with palace liaisons. Coordinating reconstruction. Reestablishing jurisdiction zones. Un-burying Marine barracks that were crushed by Bananagators."

She says the last part with a deadpan so dry it could sand a table.

---

> "He hates it," she adds after a beat. "He's not a desk guy. Watching civilians walk past the rubble when he can't help every single one of them-it's eating him up."

She glances to the side, expression tightening for a second.

> "...But he's still showing up. Every day. Without fail."

---

You nod slowly.

> "Sounds like someone I know."

She doesn't respond. Just takes another bite and avoids eye contact.

---

But then... a sly flicker of something glints in her eye. Something unspoken. She leans in a bit, elbow resting on the crate between you.

> "Also..."

She drops her voice, almost conspiratorially:

> "He's fuming over some nonsense the *World Economy News* printed."

You tilt your head.

> "The one where they said he *single-handedly defeated Crocodile* and *saved the entire country by himself*?"

> "Yeah. Saw that."

> "Did he throw the paper?"

> "He threw the paper. Then lit it on fire. Then kicked it into the river."

---

You both laugh.

It's a little too loud for the quiet corner of the market.

You don't apologize.

---

Tashigi shifts slightly, more relaxed now. There's something satisfied in her posture, like the burdens of command are a little lighter here, skewers in hand, no reports to write.

> "He's pretending not to know," she says softly, "but HQ's promoting him."

You raise an eyebrow.

> "Really? Commodore?"

She nods.

> "Won't admit it. Keeps trying to correct the record, send in rebuttals. They keep printing the same headline."

> "‘Hero of Alabasta.'"

---

You whistle.

> "Think he's gonna start carrying business cards with that on it?"

Tashigi snorts into her drink.

> "Not unless the back says ‘Shut Up and Move.'"

---

A pause.

The firelight flickers.

> "...He also put in a promotion request for me."

Her voice is quieter now. Not sheepish. Just... surprised. Grateful. A little vulnerable.

> "Didn't tell me."

> "But I caught the draft before it got filed."

You blink.

> "That's some detective work."

She shrugs.

> "Ensign's not that big a jump."

A pause.

> "But it means he trusts me."

---

You raise your skewer like a glass.

> "To Ensign Tashigi."

She raises hers in kind.

> "To Mister Pineapple, Slayer of Crocodiles and Inventor of Non-Lethal Fruit Golems."

---

You clink kebabs.  
It is, unquestionably, the most **Alabastan toast** imaginable.

---

**OOC: Your bond with Tashigi has deepened.**  
She's allowing herself moments of *relaxation* around you now.  
Of vulnerability. Of human connection, outside the Marine code.

Would you like to:

1. {Walk her back to the palace. A quiet end to a long day.}  
2. {Head to the training fields-test your new elemental alarm idea. She might even want to spar.}  
3. {Ask her something more personal-you've never had a better moment.}

>> USER: ​Option 1 - You know, you really know your way around with that sword of yours. We should spar sometime. Always wanted to pick up a few tricks. I gesture at my baton.

All this? Self taught. Martial art books at the local library, and a class at an old people's home about "defending yourself from the less elderly." I think ended up getting a yellow belt in some art, I don't even know which, or what it means.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Returning from the Market District]**  
**Scene: "A Walk, a Wandering Blade, and the Secret Yellow Belt"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Light | Mood: Intimate, Self-Deprecating Warmth, a Hint of Affection in the Air**

---

The market's glow falls behind you both, replaced by the **cool hush of moonlit alleys**, the flicker of lanterns, the distant calls of guards doing their rounds. You're walking back shoulder to shoulder, the kebabs long gone, but the sense of warmth lingering like the tang of spice on your tongue.

---

> "You know," you begin, spinning your collapsed baton lazily in one hand,  
> "You really know your way around with that sword of yours."

**Tashigi**, who'd been quietly enjoying the rare sound of peace, gives a faint side-smile.

> "...That's the nicest way anyone's ever said ‘you nearly stabbed me the first time we met.'"

---

You smirk, lifting your hands in mock innocence.

> "It's a compliment!"

> "I mean it. We should spar sometime."

You jab your baton outward like it's a fencing foil. It whistles through the air with... enthusiasm, if not elegance.

---

> "Always wanted to pick up a few tricks."

You pause, tapping the side of your head.

> "Everything I know came from self-study. Martial arts books at the local library. And one community class at a retirement home."

She stares.

You nod, solemn.

> "Taught by a 93-year-old woman named Lady Riko. The class was called *‘Defend Yourself from the Less Elderly.'*"

---

Tashigi makes a sound-somewhere between a cough and a laugh-trying and failing to contain the grin stretching across her face.

> "You're joking."

> "I'm not."

> "...You *are.*"

> "I got a yellow belt!" you declare proudly.

> "...In something."

You shrug.

> "I don't remember what. It had a very long name and some of it might've been misprinted."

Tashigi shakes her head sl</pre>
