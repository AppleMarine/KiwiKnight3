<pre>ge Roll: (1d8+2) → **7 + 2 = 9**  
- Status: **Staggered, CON Save (Stun from Sea-Prism):**  
   - Agent Roll: (1d20+1) → **5 + 1 = 6**  
   - **FAIL.**

---

**CRACK.**

The baton lands *square across his ribs*, sending a *sickening thump* through the depot. The Sea-Prism tip glows briefly as it connects-**nullifying energy**, scrambling nerves, breaking his stance.

The agent **gurgles**, drops his second boomerang, and **collapses to one knee**-stunned, windless.

---

One of the guards gasps.

> "Whoa. That was-was that Sea-Prism? Is he still breathing?"

> "He's fine," you mutter.  
> "Just not going anywhere for a while."

---

**Kiwi Kop continues sitting merrily on the explosives guy**, who's now flailing uselessly with only a muffled groan escaping beneath pulpy pressure.

---

**Tashigi doesn't smile-but her voice drops an octave.**

> "Nice swing. Your form's improving."

You let out a half-chuckle.

> "All those beatings from you finally paid off."

---

**Combat Ends - Total Victory.**

- **Agent 1:** Unconscious, captured.  
- **Agent 2:** Restrained by Kiwi Kop.  
- **Explosives secured.**  
- **No casualties.**  
- **Tashigi:** Slightly impressed. Maybe a little more than slightly.

---

**Loot / Clues:**

- 1 Den Den Mushi (was active recently, still warm)  
- Open crates of **unmarked weapons** and **Baroque Works insignia** armor fragments  
- A folded map showing **tunnels leading east of Alubarna**, with multiple X marks along old **rebel staging camps**  
- A sealed envelope, waxed in **Crocodile's sigil** - unopened

---

Would you like to:

1. {Help restrain the agents for interrogation-maybe see what the envelope says.}  
2. {Check the map and report this to Smoker immediately. Potential sleeper cells.}  
3. {Open the envelope in private first. You're the one who bled for this.}

>> USER: ​Optio X: Crush the detonator. 

That should remove the threat of that crate of explosives in the corner.

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandstone Depot - Post-Combat Secure Phase]**  
**Scene: "Better Safe Than Boom"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Precautionary | Mood: Controlled, Cautious, Dust-Settled Tension**

---

The air is still buzzing from the clash-**the scent of scorched dust and citrus still heavy.** Kiwi Kop emits a gurgling purr as he maintains pressure on the squirming explosives handler, who is slowly realizing that oxygen, like ambition, is in short supply beneath a juice elemental.

You glance at the **scroll-sized detonator**, sitting on the nearby crate-its runes glowing faintly, trembling with unspent potential. Your eyes flick to the stack of **aged explosive crates** tucked along the wall, **Baroque Works sigils half-burned into the wood.**

Your fingers twitch toward your baton.

---

> "Nope," you mutter.  
> "We don't play with live fireworks in a wooden depot."

**With one fluid motion-**

You **slam the Sea-Prism baton down** on the detonator scroll.

**ROLL: Baton Strike - Delicate Device, Non-Magical Neutralization**  
- (1d20+4) → 17 + 4 = **21**  
- Result: **SUCCESS**

---

The baton connects with a sharp **CRACK**, shattering the talisman into two curling, fizzling strips. A pulse of heated air ripples across the room, but the runes extinguish-**like a flame smothered by willpower and citrusy disdain.**

The nearby crates stop humming.

> "Well," one of the guards breathes out, "I just unclenched muscles I forgot I had."

---

Tashigi nods in quiet approval, giving the crates a careful inspection.

> "No secondary trigger. Scroll was the main conduit. Nicely done."

You give a mock bow.

> "Preventing sudden combustion: just part of the job now, ma'am."

---

The depot falls into that **strangely sacred post-battle silence**, broken only by the faint squeaks of the Den Den Mushi still sitting on the crate. It's not transmitting anymore, but it **was active.**

And that envelope-still sealed, still untouched-rests quietly in the shadow of the weapons rack.

---

**Kiwi Kop slowly raises one syrupy arm, giving you a thumbs-up. Probably.**  
You're not sure what that gesture means in his species.

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Open the envelope and read what Baroque left behind.}  
2. {Pass the envelope to Tashigi, letting her handle it as ranking officer.}  
3. {Secure the site and call in reinforcements. You've cleared the quarry, but there may be more out there.}

>> USER: ​Option 2 - Observe the detonator that I squashed

OOC: I will discover something soon from the detonator. (I'll reveal later)

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandstone Depot - Moments After the Bang That Never Was]**  
**Scene: "Trembling Threads"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Suspicious | Mood: Slow-Build Realization, Controlled Curiosity**

---

You crouch over the remains of the detonator scroll, baton still humming faintly from the impact.

At first, it's just **charred parchment**, still smoldering faintly at the edges. Standard **Baroque-issue explosive rune work**-you'd seen similar schematics during a post-battle briefing from a palace engineer.

But there's something... **off.**

---

You squint.

The inner layer of the scroll-curled like a burnt cinnamon roll-has **an additional inscription** underneath the primary trigger runes. Hidden by the top parchment. Smaller. Carved **not with ink**, but **pressed indentations**, nearly invisible unless you were up close.

You trace your fingers gently along the grooves.

It's **not a second explosive command.**

It's...

> *"D.E. - 402. NW of Alubarna. Burn after use. He suspects."*

Your brow furrows.

D.E.?

---

You glance up as **Tashigi takes the sealed envelope**, her expression unreadable as she slips it into a protected pouch on her belt.

> "Chain of evidence. Smoker should see it first," she mutters.

You nod slowly-but your focus is still on the **new inscription.**

You mutter under your breath:

> "Not just a bomb. This was a *message.* Hidden beneath the trigger."

---

And the timing...

The scroll was still active.

Which meant **whoever was listening... might've been waiting for a signal.**

Or worse-

They might've **heard everything up to the moment you crushed it.**

---

**OOC: You've uncovered a covert coordination network. "D.E." is a code. Possibly a person. Possibly a site. Possibly a trap.**  
You have a lead: **"402 - NW of Alubarna."** Perhaps a rendezvous point, bunker, or fallback zone.

**Clue quietly logged.** Only you noticed the hidden message.

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Keep this information private for now-too soon to trust anyone fully.}  
2. {Tell Tashigi discreetly when the guards aren't listening.}  
3. {Tell Smoker directly once you return to the palace. Let him decide.}

>> USER: ​Option X - This isn't a detonator... It looks more like a timer...

I glance over at the 'quiet' crate of explosives in the corner, where Tashigi is pulling a bundle of folders off a shelf.

OOC - Pause 

>> ASSISTANT: **[Sandstone Depot - Time Bomb]**  
**Scene: "The Clock You Didn't Hear Ticking"**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Sudden Dread | Mood: Rising Tension, Snap Realization**

---

You freeze.

Your gaze slowly turns from the cracked scroll beneath your hand...  
...to the **row of crates** in the far corner.

The ones with the **Baroque sigils** half-sanded away.  
The ones you'd assumed were inert.  
The ones Tashigi now stands beside-one boot casually planted on a reinforced lid, pulling down a bundle of weather-worn folders from a high shelf.

---

And then the gears in your mind begin to **click.**

**It wasn't a remote detonator.**  
**It was a delay fuse. A countdown.**

A *start* trigger.

---

The scroll you crushed...  
*Didn't deactivate anything.*  
It **started something.**

You catch a faint sound-**not a hum**, not magic-but the **deep, mechanical *ticking*** you'd missed beneath the citrus stink and adrenaline.

The **crates are hot again.**  
Too hot.

---

> "Tashigi-"

Your voice is tight, rough, forced through a throat suddenly too small.

> "Tashigi, MOVE."
