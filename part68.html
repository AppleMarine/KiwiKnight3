<pre>the Rubber Reckoning**

> "*GOMU GOMU NO... BAZOOKA!!*"

---

A blur of red and gold **slams into Crocodile's torso** with the force of a cannonball.

**Luffy**, wild-eyed, cloak flapping, hits him like a comet-both fists **buried into the Warlord's chest**.

---

The explosion of sand is **immediate and violent.**  
Crocodile is launched backward, skidding across the rooftop tiles in a **spray of grit and gravel**.

Tashigi covers her face from the blast, stunned.

---

**Crocodile lands, rolls, and slides-**

Then **slowly rises.**

---

Not a scratch.

Not even a tear in his coat.

---

> "Hmph."

> "Rubber."

He dusts his shoulder.

> "You're one of *Whitebeard's pet insects,* aren't you?"

---

**Luffy lands, face shadowed beneath his hat.**

He says nothing.

---

Tashigi, still kneeling, watches from the ledge.  
Her eyes are wide, her voice hoarse.

> "He's not just fighting him..."

> "He's challenging a Warlord."

---

The wind howls.  
The sandstorm swirls.  
And two titans stand across from each other on the edge of the world.

---

**OOC:**  
- **Tashigi** is wounded, out of the fight-for now.  
- **Luffy** has initiated combat with **Crocodile**, Round One.  
- **Crocodile is amused, but no longer toying.**  
- The real battle for Alabasta has begun.

---

**Meanwhile...**

Down an alley several blocks away, a **green-tinted blur** of moisture is now **zipping** down the cobblestone like an overcaffeinated garden hose.

You've hit **moderate cruising speed.**

A passing stray cat watches you slither by with a look of sheer confusion.

---

Would you like to follow:  
1. {The battle between Luffy and Crocodile}  
2. {Tashigi trying to regroup or rejoin}  
3. {Eatone closing in-fast(er), perhaps even upright soon}

>> USER: Option 2 - Tashigi is heavily injured, unlikely to be combat effective for a long time.

Meanwhile, the rest of the straw hats are in a protective ring around Vivi, as she pleads for the fighting to stop. Tashigi, form her vantage point, notices some oddly moving guards approaching from a blind spot. But she's too winded to do or say anything about it

---

**Tashigi lies slumped** against the cracked edge of the palace rooftop.

Her ribs scream. Her vision blurs.

She can *still hear* the clash of fists behind her-**Luffy hammering into Crocodile**, wild and furious-but she doesn't dare turn to look again. Every shift in her ribs feels like gravel grinding in her chest.

> *I can't... move.*

She grips the tile, trying to rise-

> *I can't... even draw my sword.*

---

But her eyes still work.

And they drift-**down.**

To the plaza.

---

**Vivi is back on her feet**, surrounded now by **Zoro, Sanji, Usopp, Nami, and Chopper**, who've formed a **ring around her**-protecting her with the sheer presence of belief.

She's calling out again.

> "Kohza! Everyone, please! This war isn't real!"

> "Crocodile's manipulating us all!"

The crowd is **wavering**, like a tide ready to shift.

---

And that's when **Tashigi sees it.**

---

From her rooftop perch, through her bleary eye-

**Four figures.**

In royal armor.

Moving too precisely.

Too slowly.

**Wrong.**

---

They approach from the **eastern quadrant** of the plaza-where **Vivi's blind side** is vulnerable.  
Their weapons are lowered, faces obscured under sand-dulled helmets.

> *Baroque Works.*

> *Assassins.* Sleeper agents embedded deep.

She tries to raise her voice.

Nothing.

Tries to stand.

Her legs *won't answer.*

---

She claws forward, dragging herself to the edge of the rooftop.

> *Please... someone... anyone-*

She watches them close in behind Vivi and the Straw Hats.

They're **seconds away**.

And **she can't stop them.**

---

**OOC: Tashigi is critically wounded and temporarily out of action.  
She has spotted a new threat: Baroque Works agents in disguise approaching Vivi's rear flank.  
Straw Hats are distracted defending from the front.**

Would you like to:

1. {Shift to Vivi and the Straw Hats - do they notice in time?}  
2. {Return to Eatone - this may be your moment.}  
3. {Explore Kohza's view-he may notice the false guards from within the crowd.}

>> USER: Option 2 / 3 - Kohza is close, but not that close to intercept.

Meanwhile, I'm approaching the plaza at a moderate pace now, worming my way around downed fighters and collapsed buildings. Some might charitably call it a jogging pace. Tashigi may notice a trail of green snaking out of one of the side streets

---

### **Scene A - Kohza, the Watchful Flame**

Amid the crowd of rebels, shouting and shoving for control, **Kohza** still stands near the fractured fountain where his rally had turned into a riot.

He's banged up. Covered in dust. **Conflicted to his core.**

---

He saw Vivi.

He *heard* her.

And despite everything-  
Despite the gunfire and the lies and the roar of the mob-  
**he believed her.**

---

But he didn't act fast enough.

---

His eyes flick to the palace again, just in time to see **Luffy crash into Crocodile**, just in time to see sand explode into the sky-

And then-

He catches movement at the plaza's edge.

Four guards, closing in from a blind angle.

> *Too clean. Too perfect.*

His brow furrows.

> "Baroque..."

He starts moving, **pushing through the crowd**-but he's too far.

Too slow.

They'll reach her **before he can.**

---

---

### **Scene B - Here Comes the Juice**

You round the corner of a fractured alley-

The sounds of battle **slam into your ears** like a wall of steel and shouting.

But you're not focused on that.

You're focused on the **green, gleaming stream** of juice **you've been sliding on** like a waterpark ride from hell.

---

You are-

- Covered in grit.  
- Slightly damp.  
- And moving at the speed of a mildly determined slug who's had one too many energy drinks.

But you're **getting there.**

---

The buildings fall away, and suddenly:

You see it.

The **plaza**.

The **chaos**.

And-just ahead-

**Four "guards" moving toward a young woman in blue.**

You don't know who the hell Kohza is.

But you know **those guards are wrong.**

And that girl?

> *That's Blue.*

---

Behind you, the green streak glistens on the ground-a ridiculous but glorious **trail of teacher justice.**

---

From **Tashigi's rooftop**, through a haze of blood and dust-

She sees it.

A **shimmer of green**.

Snaking through the rubble.

> "...You crazy son of a-"

---

**OOC: You are now within striking distance of the Baroque agents sneaking up on Vivi.  
You may only have time for **one** decisive move before they strike.**

Would you like to:

1. {Launch a high-speed glob of juice at their legs-trip or blind them.}  
2. {Throw yourself between them and Vivi-full body interception.}  
3. {Scream a warning-risk your position, but alert the Straw Hats.}  
4. {Unleash a surprise Kiwi Elemental-if you've got it in you.}

ðŸŒ€ Make your move, Sensei.

>> USER: Option 2 - ...oh shit Blue!

Too weak to stand, too weak to launch a jet of juice, but enough to will my snaking river of juice to push me faster, faster, faster til I'm a barreling exotic flavored human torpedo.

I might arrive just in time to take a blow

>> ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Human Torpedo of Justice]**  
**Scene: "Don't You Touch My Kids"**  
**Tone: Raw Instinct | Mood: Desperate Impact, Bitter Timing**

---

The crowd doesn't notice.

The chaos drowns everything.

Screams, sand, shouting, smoke-it all **blurs** as the four Baroque agents, disguised as royal guards, move in behind **Vivi**.

Their blades are **drawn low**, close to their cloaks. No grand attacks. Just **assassin's work**.

Two steps from striking </pre>
